      Approval required from OWNER_EMAIL before commitment.

      Weekly operating review ritual (not a deliverable).

      Participants: Product owner, eng lead, lane representatives.
      Agenda: Metrics review, governance compliance, risks, priorities.
      Output: Filled scoreboard committed to docs/operations/scoreboard-{YYYY-WW}.md
