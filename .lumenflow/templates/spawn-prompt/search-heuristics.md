## Search Strategy (Broad to Narrow)

When exploring the codebase:

1. **Start broad**: Use Explore agent or glob patterns to understand structure
2. **Evaluate findings**: What patterns exist? What's relevant?
3. **Narrow focus**: Target specific files/functions based on findings
4. **Iterate**: Refine if initial approach misses the target

Avoid: Jumping directly to specific file edits without understanding context.
