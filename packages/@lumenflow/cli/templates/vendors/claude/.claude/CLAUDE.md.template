# Claude Code Configuration

**Last updated:** {{DATE}}

This project uses LumenFlow workflow. For workflow documentation, see [LUMENFLOW.md](../LUMENFLOW.md).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Read workflow documentation
# See LUMENFLOW.md for complete workflow

# 2. Claim a WU
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-XXXX --lane <Lane>
cd worktrees/<lane>-wu-xxxx

# 3. Work in worktree, run gates
pnpm gates

# 4. Complete (ALWAYS run this!)
cd {{PROJECT_ROOT}}
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXXX
```

---

## Critical: Always wu:done

After completing work, ALWAYS run `pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXXX`.

See [LUMENFLOW.md](../LUMENFLOW.md) and [ai/onboarding/troubleshooting-wu-done.md](../ai/onboarding/troubleshooting-wu-done.md).
