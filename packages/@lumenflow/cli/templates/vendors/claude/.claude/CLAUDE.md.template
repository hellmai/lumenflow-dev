# Claude Code Configuration

**Last updated:** {{DATE}}

This project uses LumenFlow workflow. For workflow documentation, see [LUMENFLOW.md](../LUMENFLOW.md).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Read workflow documentation
# See LUMENFLOW.md for complete workflow

# 2. Claim a WU
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-XXXX --lane <Lane>
cd worktrees/<lane>-wu-xxxx

# 3. Work in worktree, run gates
pnpm gates

# 4. Complete (ALWAYS run this!)
cd {{PROJECT_ROOT}}
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXXX
```

> **Complete CLI reference:** See [quick-ref-commands.md](../ai/onboarding/quick-ref-commands.md)

---

## Critical: Always wu:done

After completing work, ALWAYS run `pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXXX`.

See [LUMENFLOW.md](../LUMENFLOW.md) and [ai/onboarding/troubleshooting-wu-done.md](../ai/onboarding/troubleshooting-wu-done.md).

## Orchestration & Memory Commands

Essential commands for multi-agent coordination and context management:

| Command                                    | Description                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `pnpm orchestrate:init-status -i INIT-XXX` | View initiative progress          |
| `pnpm orchestrate:monitor`                 | Monitor spawn/agent activity      |
| `pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-XXX`          | Save progress checkpoint          |
| `pnpm mem:inbox --since 30m`               | Check coordination signals        |
| `pnpm mem:signal "msg" --wu WU-XXX`        | Broadcast signal to other agents  |
| `pnpm mem:create "msg" --wu WU-XXX`        | Create memory node (bug capture)  |
| `pnpm wu:spawn --id WU-XXX --client claude-code` | Spawn sub-agent prompt     |

**When to checkpoint:**
- After each acceptance criterion completed
- Before running gates
- Every 30+ tool calls

**When to check inbox:**
- Before starting complex work (parallel agents may have signals)
- When blocked (other agents may have completed dependencies)
