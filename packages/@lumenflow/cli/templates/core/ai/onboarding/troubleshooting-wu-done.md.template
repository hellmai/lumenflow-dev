# Troubleshooting: wu:done Not Run

**Last updated:** {{DATE}}

## The Problem

Agents complete their work, write "To Complete: pnpm wu:done" and then **stop without running the command**.

## The Fix

After gates pass, you MUST run:

```bash
cd {{PROJECT_ROOT}}
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX
```

Do NOT:
- Ask "Should I run wu:done?"
- Write "To Complete: pnpm wu:done"
- Wait for permission

## Checklist Before Ending Session

- [ ] Did I run `pnpm gates` in the worktree?
- [ ] Did gates pass?
- [ ] Did I `cd` back to main?
- [ ] Did I run `pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX`?
- [ ] Did wu:done complete successfully?

If any answer is "no", you're not done yet.
