title: WIP=1 Enforcement + Lane Generation Tooling
description: 'Replace configurable WIP limits with WIP=1 as default (require justification for WIP >
  1), and add lane generation tooling so well-defined lanes make WIP=1 always sufficient.
  Philosophy: If you need WIP > 1, you need better lanes, not higher limits.'
