success_metrics:
  - Checkpoint entries are created automatically in active WU sessions when enforcement is enabled
  - Signal read-marking remains correct under concurrent agents (no lost updates)
  - INIT-015 recovery context includes recent checkpoint data for active WUs
  - Decay archival reduces stale memory accumulation when enabled
