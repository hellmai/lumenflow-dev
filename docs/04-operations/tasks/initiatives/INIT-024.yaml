title: Align wu:spawn semantics with delegation provenance
description: Align command semantics, provenance recording, and enforcement so delegation tracking
  is accurate across clients and orchestration. Separate pure prompt generation from side-effectful
  delegation tracking, and evolve provenance from intent-only to intent-plus-pickup evidence.

success_metrics:
  - Codex and Claude client modes both persist delegation lineage when requested (no early-return
    drop).
  - Prompt generation is available as a pure command with no hidden side effects.
  - Delegation registry records intent via explicit side-effect command and is no longer conflated
    with prompt-only generation.
  - Completion enforcement can distinguish delegation intent from actual pickup evidence and
    supports audited overrides.
