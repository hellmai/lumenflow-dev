title: Fix Agent Degradation and Worktree Discipline
description: |
  Agent quality has significantly degraded - agents write to main instead of worktrees,
  don't complete tasks (used to be 9/10), and don't create bugs via mem:triage.

  Primary root cause: wu:spawn output truncation causes ~90% context loss.
  Secondary factors: Fail-open hook bugs, missing recovery guidance.
