title: Vendor-Agnostic Multi-Client Architecture
description: >
  Establish vendor-agnostic patterns layer (.lumenflow/rules/, patterns/) and multi-client
  generation (Cursor, Windsurf). Adopt research patterns: retrospective checkpoints,
  writer/reviewer workflow, prompt debugging. Eliminates DRY violations in client configs
  and positions LumenFlow as IDE-agnostic framework.
