title: Configurable lane lock policy + active-state WIP accounting
description: 'Introduce configurable lane lock policy and trunk-based active WIP accounting to
  reduce idle time without sacrificing coordination safety. Provide lock_policy per lane
  (active|all|none), define active vs blocked behavior in trunk flow (blocked WUs release lane locks
  when policy=active), and ensure orchestrator/spawn respect the configured policy. Pilot on
  low-conflict lanes (Content: Documentation) with clear rollback guidance.'

    title: Update orchestrator/CLI + docs + pilot guidance

success_metrics:
  - Lanes can set lock_policy and behavior changes as configured
  - Waiting/blocked WUs no longer hold lane locks when policy=active
  - Pilot lane shows reduced idle time without increased conflict rate
