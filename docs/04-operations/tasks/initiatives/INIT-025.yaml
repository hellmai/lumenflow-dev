title: God File Decomposition Initiative
description: Deliver enterprise-grade decomposition with state-machine-first hardening of wu:done
  (explicit XState pipeline, staged rollback consolidation, and gate dedup baseline), followed by
  mechanical god-file splits and cleanup coverage work.
status: in_progress

notes:
  - '2026-02-13 reconciliation: WU-1621 completed prerequisite initiative metadata hardening;
    decomposition execution scope remains pending. INIT-025 reopened to in_progress.'
  - '2026-02-13 WU-1639: initiative metadata reconciled with delivered scope; decomposition
    execution WUs remain to be planned and executed.'
  - '2026-02-13 post-WU-1640: reopened for execution; decomposition phases/WUs still pending
    delivery.'
  - '2026-02-13 phase interpretation for execution: Phase 1 = reconciliation + wu:done state machine
    foundation; Phase 2 = mechanical decomposition WUs; Phase 3 = coverage hardening and legacy
    rollback cleanup.'
  - '2026-02-13 execution kickoff: Phase 1 reconciliation/state-machine foundation WUs
    (WU-1661..WU-1666) are now specified and ready for claim order.'
