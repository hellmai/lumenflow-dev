title: Intelligent Orchestration - Memory Context + Spawn Supervision
description: "Transform LumenFlow's multi-agent orchestration from cold starts to warm orchestration
  through two complementary pillars: Memory Intelligence (context injection, knowledge promotion,
  decay scoring) and Supervision Infrastructure (monitoring, patrol mode). Agents start with
  accumulated project knowledge and remain healthy through continuous supervision."

success_metrics:
  - Spawned agents receive relevant context (mem:context block in prompt)
  - Project knowledge persists across WUs (mem:promote → mem:profile)
  - Memory stays relevant over time (decay score affects ranking)
  - Stuck spawns detected within configured threshold (default 30min)
  - Patrol mode runs continuously without flapping
