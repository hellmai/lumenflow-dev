description: "Transform LumenFlow's multi-agent orchestration from cold starts to warm orchestration
  through two complementary pillars: Memory Intelligence (context injection, knowledge promotion,
  decay scoring) and Supervision Infrastructure (monitoring, patrol mode). Agents start with
  accumulated project knowledge and remain healthy through continuous supervision."
