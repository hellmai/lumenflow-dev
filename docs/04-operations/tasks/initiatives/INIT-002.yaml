title: Hexagonal Architecture Refactor for @lumenflow/core
description: >-
  Refactor @lumenflow/core to follow the hexagonal architecture mandated in
  lumenflow-complete.md (§2.2, §4). Currently only ~4% of the codebase follows
  hex patterns. This initiative will establish proper ports, application layer
  (use cases), and infrastructure adapters to make LumenFlow a sellable,
  well-architected product.
