title: 'Kernel Hardening: Network Policy, macOS Sandbox, Advanced Scope Controls'
description: 'Harden the LumenFlow kernel based on community feedback and competitive analysis.
  Addresses top gaps: granular network allowlisting, macOS sandbox support, argument-level policy
  rules, time-boxed permissions, and dynamic policy reload. Maintains four-layer integrated kernel
  position (scope + evidence + policy + sandbox) against emerging single-layer competitors
  (AgentBouncr, Reg.Run, Hivemind). See
  ~/.lumenflow/strategy/lumenflow-dev/strategy/hn-competitive-intelligence.md for full research.'
