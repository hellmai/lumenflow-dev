title: Methodology Configurability - Templates + resolvePolicy
description: 'Allow teams to choose their testing methodology (TDD, test-after, none) and
  architecture guidance (hexagonal, layered, none) via config. The chosen methodology drives BOTH
  agent prompting (wu:spawn) and enforcement defaults (gates) through a single resolvePolicy()
  resolver. Core principle: Workflow is invariant, but coding practices are team decisions.'
