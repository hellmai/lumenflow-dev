title: UX Surfaces — Web Dashboard, Pack DX, AG-UI, Marketplace
description: 'User-facing surfaces initiative: real-time web dashboard for agent observability, pack
  authoring DX with git/registry distribution, AG-UI protocol compatibility for GenUI, and pack
  marketplace for community adoption. Two personas: (1) software devs using the software delivery
  pack who want to see agents working and trust the automation, (2) pack authors/consumers who want
  to teach their AI new domains. Differentiator vs OpenClaw: governance you can see — scope
  intersection, policy decisions, evidence receipts rendered live in the browser.'
