success_metrics:
  - state:doctor reports zero broken-event inconsistencies after delete operations
  - wu:delete never leaves stale references in projections, initiatives, or state event streams
  - wu:done no longer enters post-merge dirty-state failure loops in standard flows
  - New regression coverage prevents reintroduction of delete/done lifecycle inconsistencies
