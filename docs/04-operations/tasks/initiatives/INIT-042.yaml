success_metrics:
  - Core exports map and root barrel complexity are reduced
  - Consumers can import through stable domain-scoped barrels
  - Core export surface has explicit domain groupings
  - Root barrel usage and churn are measurably reduced
  - Consumer imports remain backward compatible during migration
