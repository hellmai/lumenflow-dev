description: 'Context: Agents can run wu:edit for an in-progress worktree WU from the main checkout, which undermines worktree discipline and confuses Source Control state. Problem: current wu:edit resolves the target worktree path and applies edits, but it does not require execution from that worktree. This permits main-checkout invocations during active lane work and creates policy drift. Solution: add an explicit execution-context guard for in-progress worktree-mode WUs so wu:edit hard-fails unless the command is run from the claimed worktree (or a child path within it), with clear remediation guidance.'
acceptance:
  - wu:edit in WORKTREE mode fails when run from main checkout
  - failure message includes target worktree path and a copy-paste cd + pnpm wu:edit retry command
  - wu:edit in WORKTREE mode still succeeds when run inside the claimed worktree
  - BRANCH_PR mode behavior remains unchanged
  - unit tests cover context guard pass/fail cases
  - pnpm --filter @lumenflow/cli lint && pnpm --filter @lumenflow/cli typecheck && targeted wu-edit tests pass
