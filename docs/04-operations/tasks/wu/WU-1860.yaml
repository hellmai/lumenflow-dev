description: 'Code review of INIT-030 found: evidence store lock leak on operation failure, dual
  now() calls creating clock skew in trace duration, partial write in writeTaskSpecImmutable leaving
  corrupt spec, non-atomic task creation, and trace recording errors propagating false CLI
  fallbacks.'
acceptance:
  - Evidence store lock file cleaned up when operation fails after lock acquired
  - Trace timestamp and duration_ms computed from single now() call
  - Tool execution results returned even if trace recording fails
  - writeTaskSpecImmutable cleans up partial file on write failure
  - Task creation handles crash between spec write and event emission
  - All kernel tests pass
