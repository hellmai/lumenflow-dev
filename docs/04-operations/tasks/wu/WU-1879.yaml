description: EvidenceStore incremental replay assumes newly rotated segment files always contain entries already indexed by the current process. In multi-instance scenarios this can miss traces. Additionally, withFileLock collapses non-lock operation errors into generic lock acquisition failures, obscuring root causes.
acceptance:
  - Incremental hydration reads unseen segment files so cross-process compaction never drops traces
  - withFileLock preserves and rethrows non-EEXIST operation errors (does not mask as lock acquisition failure)
  - Regression tests cover multi-instance compaction replay and non-lock I/O error propagation
