description: Update memory docs to reflect .lumenflow/memory, add missing agent-invocation-guide.md
  referenced by skills/playbook, and document optional pre-clear checkpoint hook guidance for
  context safety.
acceptance:
  - execution-memory skill references .lumenflow/memory paths and no longer claims .lumenflow/memory
    storage
  - agent-invocation-guide.md exists at docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/
    with context-loading and spawn-prompt guidance
  - context-management skill includes optional pre-clear checkpoint hook guidance
