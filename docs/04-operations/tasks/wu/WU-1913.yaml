description: Reference pages need kernel architecture context. cli.mdx has undocumented task:claim.
  mcp.mdx describes old thin-wrapper pattern. config.mdx has no packs section. No workspace spec
  reference page exists. Sidebar needs restructuring.
acceptance:
  - cli.mdx documents task:claim with usage guidance and kernel context
  - mcp.mdx architecture section updated for pack dispatch model
  - config.mdx includes packs configuration section
  - New workspace-spec.mdx reference page documents workspace spec with packs array and integrity
  - astro.config.mjs sidebar restructured with kernel concepts before software-delivery concepts
  - Cross-page consistency verified with no conflicting descriptions of LumenFlow
  - pnpm docs:validate passes with zero errors
  - Site builds successfully and is ready for Vercel deploy
