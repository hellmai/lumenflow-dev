description: |
  Cloud/web agents are blocked by LumenFlow hooks because hooks only detect
  worktrees, not branch names. This prevents agents from working on ad-hoc
  branches (e.g., agent/prompt-studio-xyz) in the main checkout.

  Solution: Add configurable agentBranchPatterns to config schema with
  branch-aware detection. Default pattern: ['agent/*']. Implements fail-closed
  security (unknown branches blocked when worktrees exist) and guarded headless
  mode (requires LUMENFLOW_ADMIN=1 or CI context).

  Plan: /home/tom/.claude/plans/eager-brewing-deer.md
acceptance:
  - 'agentBranchPatterns added to GitConfigSchema (default: agent/*)'
  - branch-check.ts module with isAgentBranch() and isHeadlessAllowed()
  - CLI helper is-agent-branch.ts for bash hook
  - Git shim uses core config for branch detection
  - Bash hook calls CLI helper with monorepo fallback paths
  - Unit tests pass with >=90% coverage on new code
  - agent/* branches bypass worktree requirements
  - main/master branches remain protected
  - Unknown branches fail-closed when worktrees exist
  - pnpm format, lint, typecheck pass
