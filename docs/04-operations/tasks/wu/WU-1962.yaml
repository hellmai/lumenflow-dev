description: workspace-init exists in CLI bin entries but is missing from the public manifest,
  causing command-manifest parity test failures, stale generated docs, and pre-release check
  failures that currently block npm release.
acceptance:
  - PUBLIC_MANIFEST includes workspace-init with correct bin path/category/description and manifest
    alignment tests pass
  - Generated CLI docs include workspace:init and docs:validate passes without drift
  - pre-release:check passes end-to-end
  - Public repo links in package metadata, templates, and Starlight docs are updated from
    hellmai/lumenflow to hellmai/lumenflow-dev
