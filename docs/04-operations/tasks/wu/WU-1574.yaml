description: 'Context: strict-error remediation currently repeats the same fixes (unknown error
  normalization, type guards, missing ambient typings) across many files. Problem: without shared
  foundations, strict migration WUs will duplicate logic, increase merge conflicts, and introduce
  inconsistent patterns. Solution: add shared strict utilities and type packages first, then make
  downstream WUs consume them consistently.'
acceptance:
  - Shared unknown-error normalization utility exists and is consumed by at least one core and one
    cli strict hotspot
  - Missing type packages for current strict blockers (for example ms or micromatch) are added with
    tests/typecheck validation
  - Shared type guards/helpers for common strict migration patterns are added in library code, not
    duplicated ad hoc
  - Documentation or code comments define expected usage of shared strict helpers
  - Foundation changes compile and are reusable by subsequent INIT-022 WUs
