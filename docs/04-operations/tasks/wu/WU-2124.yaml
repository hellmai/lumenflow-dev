  manual:
    - Verify PathFactory API is exported from @lumenflow/core and importable by cli and mcp packages
    - Verify pnpm test passes for core
    - cli
    - and mcp packages

notes: 'Single-session: ~6 files across 3 packages (core, cli, mcp). Requires designing and
  implementing a new PathFactory API and migrating 3 independent call patterns. Sized as Simple per
  wu-sizing-guide.md (under 20 files, estimated ~40 tool calls). Plan: wild-foraging-taco.md Phase 3

description: 'Three independent path resolution patterns exist across the codebase instead of a
  single factory: (1) direct path.join from REPO_ROOT, (2) ILocationResolver.resolveRoot() adapter
  calls, (3) inline __dirname-relative paths. Create a single PathFactory in core/src/ that all
  packages use. Reduces coupling and makes path resolution testable at one boundary.'
acceptance:
  - PathFactory created in packages/@lumenflow/core/src/ with consistent API
  - 3 independent path resolution patterns consolidated to use PathFactory
  - All affected packages (core, cli, mcp) use PathFactory
  - pnpm test for affected packages passes
