description: 'Context: initiative and gates command paths still carry concentrated strict debt in CLI orchestration flow. Problem: these code paths are central to orchestration safety and need strict-safe typing before final strict enablement. Solution: remediate implicit any and unknown handling in initiative and gates command implementations while preserving contract behavior and diagnostics.'
acceptance:
  - Strict errors are removed from targeted initiative and gates command files
  - Command behavior and output contracts remain unchanged under existing tests
  - No net increase in as any usage in touched files
  - Relevant CLI orchestration and enforcement tests pass
  - Progress baseline reflects reduced strict debt for this cluster
