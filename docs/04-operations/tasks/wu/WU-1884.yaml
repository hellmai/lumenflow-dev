description: 'Phase 6 of INIT-031 is currently framed around community-pack breadth, but delivery
  focus has shifted to proving pack #1 (software-delivery) end-to-end through runtime-native
  execution. This WU updates initiative framing and success criteria so execution and reporting
  align with the approved pack-first strategy.'
acceptance:
  - INIT-031 Phase 6 title and notes explicitly describe software-delivery pack completion as the
    primary objective
  - 'Community-pack expansion is explicitly deferred until pack #1 runtime-native completion
    criteria are met'
  - INIT-031 Phase 6 WU inventory references the software-delivery migration WU chain
    (WU-1885..WU-1892)
