tests:
  manual:
    - Run pnpm initiative:status --id INIT-030 and verify phase 6 scope text reflects
      software-delivery-first strategy
    - Run pnpm initiative:status --id INIT-031 and verify reassignment note is present while
      WU-1884..WU-1897 are tracked under INIT-030

description: Consolidate the software-delivery migration stream under INIT-030 Phase 6 and record
  reassignment context from INIT-031 to avoid dual-ownership confusion in planning, orchestration,
  and status reporting.
acceptance:
  - INIT-030 Phase 6 title and notes explicitly describe software-delivery pack completion and
    runtime migration quality as the primary objective
  - INIT-030 Phase 6 WU inventory references the complete migration chain (WU-1884..WU-1897)
    including decomposition WUs
  - INIT-031 retains a reassignment note and does not actively track WU-1884..WU-1897 in its own WU
    inventory
