description: 'Phase 6 of INIT-031 is currently framed around community-pack breadth, but delivery focus has shifted to proving pack #1 (software-delivery) end-to-end through runtime-native execution. This WU updates initiative framing and success criteria so execution and reporting align with the approved pack-first strategy.'
acceptance:
  - INIT-031 Phase 6 title and notes explicitly describe software-delivery pack completion as the primary objective
  - 'Community-pack expansion is explicitly deferred until pack #1 runtime-native completion criteria are met'
  - INIT-031 Phase 6 WU inventory references the software-delivery migration WU chain (WU-1885..WU-1892)
