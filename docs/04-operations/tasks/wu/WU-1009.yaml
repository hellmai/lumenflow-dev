  The "5-minute" experience for new users.

  Flow:
  1. Install GitHub App (1 click)
  2. Add config file (copy-paste)
  3. Create first WU (one command)
  4. See it work (open PR, see validation)

  Should work without npm CLI (GitHub App only for Free tier).

description: |
  Write a quickstart guide that gets users from zero to working
  LumenFlow in under 5 minutes.

  Context: Users finding LumenFlow on Marketplace need clear
  onboarding path.

  Problem: No step-by-step guide for new users.

  Solution: Single-page quickstart with copy-paste examples.
acceptance:
  - Guide covers GitHub App installation
  - Includes sample .lumenflow.config.yaml
  - Shows how to create first WU
  - Demonstrates PR validation working
  - Works for Free tier (no npm CLI required)
  - Tested on fresh repo
