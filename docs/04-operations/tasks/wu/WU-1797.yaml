description: 'Context: Phase 3 requires software-delivery workflow operations to be expressed as pack-composed runtime tools. Problem: WU YAML lifecycle operations are still handled primarily by imperative CLI pathways rather than runtime-managed pack execution. Solution: add pack tool descriptors and runtime integration for WU metadata lifecycle operations so they execute through ToolHost with receipts and scope enforcement.'
acceptance:
  - Software-delivery pack exposes runtime tool descriptors for WU metadata lifecycle operations with explicit permission and scope requirements.
  - KernelRuntime can register and execute at least one WU metadata lifecycle operation through pack tool execution with evidence receipts.
  - At least one production surface command path routes a WU metadata lifecycle operation through the runtime-managed pack tool path.
