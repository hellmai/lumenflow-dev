description: 'Consolidates WU-1229 and WU-1318. Issues: (1) wu:block fails if status.md missing
  sections, (2) auto-repair push blocked by pre-push hook (missing LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL env), (3)
  orphaned temp worktrees not cleaned up on failure, (4) noisy prettier warning when not installed.
  Solution: harden error handling, set env vars, ensure cleanup, gracefully handle missing
  prettier.'
acceptance:
  - wu:block handles missing status.md sections gracefully
  - Micro-worktree operations set LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL to bypass pre-push hook
  - Failed operations clean up temp worktrees before exit
  - formatFiles skips formatting when prettier unavailable without throwing
  - Warning message is clear and actionable if formatting skipped
