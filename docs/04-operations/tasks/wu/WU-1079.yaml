description: WU-1075 renamed .lumenflow to .lumenflow but left 68 stamp files in the old location,
  causing all done WUs to appear as orphans and blocking wu:claim
acceptance:
  - All stamp files moved from .lumenflow/stamps/ to .lumenflow/stamps/
  - .lumenflow/stamps/ directory removed
  - wu:claim no longer reports orphan done WUs
