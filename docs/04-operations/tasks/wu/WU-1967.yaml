description: 'Context: CLAUDE.md contains a hardcoded lane table (Framework: Core, Framework: CLI,
  etc.) that is stale -- these parent lanes were subdivided into granular sub-lanes but the table
  was never updated. This caused an agent to pick an invalid lane name. Problem: Duplicate source of
  truth for lanes. The yaml config is canonical but CLAUDE.md has a stale copy that misleads agents.
  Solution: Replace the lane table in CLAUDE.md with a brief note pointing to .lumenflow.config.yaml
  as the canonical source. Lanes are dynamic -- add them as needed.'
acceptance:
  - CLAUDE.md no longer contains a hardcoded lane table
  - CLAUDE.md references .lumenflow.config.yaml as the canonical lane source
  - No other docs reference the old parent-only lane names as if they are the full list
