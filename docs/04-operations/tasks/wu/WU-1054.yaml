description: Fix npm publish workflow failure (github-app missing private:true) and document the complete release process for agents including versioning, npm publishing, Starlight docs sync, and GitHub App deployment. Also fix inappropriate private repo links in public docs.
acceptance:
  - GitHub App package marked as private (not publishable to npm)
  - Release process documentation created for agent onboarding
  - 'Documentation covers: version bumping, npm publish workflow, Starlight deployment, GitHub App sync'
  - Private repo links in Starlight docs replaced with appropriate public links
  - npm publish workflow succeeds on re-run
