description: Release script from WU-1074 has bugs that required manual intervention on main branch,
  defeating the micro-worktree isolation purpose
acceptance:
  - hasNpmAuth() detects auth from ~/.npmrc not just env vars
  - Changeset pre mode is detected and exited in micro-worktree
  - Tag push bypasses pre-push hooks via LUMENFLOW_FORCE
  - No manual commands required on main branch during release
