    - Execute mem:create, mem:delete, mem:export through runtime path and verify expected memory
      state mutations

notes: 'Sizing: Medium (expected 15-20 files, 50-70 tool calls). Strategy: Checkpoint-Resume. Gap
  identified during INIT-030 Phase 6 dry-run audit — WU-1896 covers only 4 of ~14 memory tools.
  WU-1889 umbrella should add this as a dependency.'

description: 'Gap fill: WU-1896 covers 4 core memory tools (mem:init, mem:checkpoint, mem:recover,
  mem:inbox) but the manifest declares ~14 memory tools total. The remaining 10 (mem:cleanup,
  mem:context, mem:create, mem:delete, mem:export, mem:signal, mem:start, mem:summarize, mem:triage,
  mem:ready) need explicit migration from resolver fallback stubs to native software-delivery pack
  handlers.'
acceptance:
  - mem:cleanup, mem:context, mem:create, mem:delete, mem:export, mem:signal, mem:start,
    mem:summarize, mem:triage, and mem:ready execute through software-delivery handlers in
    bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated extended memory commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated memory commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration
    mode
