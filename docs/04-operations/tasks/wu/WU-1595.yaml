description: 'Context: Review of WU-1589 found edge-case and coverage gaps in cloud branch foundation behavior. Problem: defaultBranchFrom can throw when claimed_branch is non-string, pre-commit branch-pr tests do not assert hook behavior, and release/recover claimed_branch reset behavior lacks direct tests. Solution: harden claimed_branch type handling, add behavior-level pre-commit branch-pr tests, and add focused tests for release/recover claim reset semantics.'
acceptance:
  - defaultBranchFrom handles non-string claimed_branch values safely and falls back to lane-derived naming without throwing.
  - Pre-commit branch-pr allowance is covered by behavior-level tests that exercise decision logic, not only regex parsing.
  - Add direct tests covering claimed_branch reset semantics in wu-release and wu-recover paths.
  - Existing branch-only/worktree behavior remains unchanged.
