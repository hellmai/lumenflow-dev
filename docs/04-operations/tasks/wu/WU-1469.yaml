description: 'Context: internal MCP framework docs still describe the legacy 7-tool model while product docs describe 68 tools, and publish auth guidance has drifted from current NPM_TOKEN usage. Problem: operators and contributors receive inconsistent documentation for launch-critical behavior. Solution: update docs to the current MCP surface area and publish authentication model, with cross-references that match implemented workflows.'
acceptance:
  - mcp-server documentation reflects the current MCP tool model and architecture
  - public docs and framework docs agree on MCP tool count and usage patterns
  - publish workflow docs accurately reflect NPM_TOKEN based auth model
  - Documentation links and references resolve to current files
