notes: >-
    Already fixed by WU-1575 (commit 7f13c604). WU-1575 updated the two stale
    .lumenflow/state assertions in init-scripts.test.ts to .lumenflow/telemetry,
    aligning with WU-1519 tracked-state policy. Verified: all 20 init-scripts tests
    and all 73 init.test.ts tests pass. No remaining stale assertions found.

description: 'Context: Main currently has failing init-scripts tests expecting .lumenflow/state in
  generated .gitignore. Problem: WU-1519 changed policy to track .lumenflow/state, so current
  template intentionally excludes only .lumenflow/telemetry and worktrees; tests are stale and
  failing on main. Solution: update/init-scripts expectations and any related assertions to match
  current tracked-state policy, restoring passing tests on main.'
acceptance:
  - init-scripts .gitignore tests no longer expect .lumenflow/state to be ignored
  - init-scripts suite passes on main after fix
