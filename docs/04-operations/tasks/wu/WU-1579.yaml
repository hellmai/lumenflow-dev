description: 'Context: Main currently has failing init-scripts tests expecting .lumenflow/state in generated .gitignore. Problem: WU-1519 changed policy to track .lumenflow/state, so current template intentionally excludes only .lumenflow/telemetry and worktrees; tests are stale and failing on main. Solution: update/init-scripts expectations and any related assertions to match current tracked-state policy, restoring passing tests on main.'
acceptance:
  - init-scripts .gitignore tests no longer expect .lumenflow/state to be ignored
  - init-scripts suite passes on main after fix
