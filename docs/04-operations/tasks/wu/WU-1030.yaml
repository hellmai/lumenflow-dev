description: >-
  Context: wu:create and wu:edit use micro-worktrees and push spec changes back to origin/main.

  Problem: the pre-push hook blocks direct pushes to main (and emits husky deprecation errors),
  leaving main ahead of origin and preventing further wu:edit runs.

  Solution: remove deprecated husky bootstrap lines and adjust the pre-push policy to allow
  wu:create/wu:edit to push successfully without LUMENFLOW_FORCE.
acceptance:
  - pnpm wu:create and pnpm wu:edit complete without LUMENFLOW_FORCE and without husky deprecation
    errors.
  - Pre-push policy allows micro-worktree pushes for wu:create/wu:edit so main is not left ahead of
    origin.
  - All husky hooks remove deprecated bootstrap lines while preserving their behavior.
  - pnpm format, lint, typecheck -> PASS
