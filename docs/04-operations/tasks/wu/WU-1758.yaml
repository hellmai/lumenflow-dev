description: fs:read builtin tool does not validate requested paths against enforced scopes — path traversal vulnerability. git:status tool accepts arbitrary commands array passed directly to spawnSync — complete security model bypass. Both undermine the ToolHost scope enforcement.
acceptance:
  - fs:read validates path against enforced scopes before reading
  - git:status commands input removed or restricted to git binary only
  - Path traversal tests added for fs:read
  - Command injection tests added for git:status
