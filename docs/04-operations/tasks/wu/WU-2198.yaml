description: wu-done-git-ops.ts:ensureMainUpToDate() wraps die() inside a try/catch that catches ALL
  errors including ProcessExitError. When main is out of sync with origin, die() throws
  ProcessExitError, but the catch at line 249 treats it as a network error and logs 'Proceeding
  anyway'. This makes the pre-flight sync check effectively a no-op — wu:done always proceeds
  regardless of sync state. The defense-in-depth check in wu-done-worktree-services.ts:174
  (validateMainNotBehindOrigin) catches the 'behind' case but NOT the 'ahead' or 'diverged' cases,
  so those slip through entirely.
acceptance:
  - ProcessExitError from die() is NOT caught by the network-error catch block in ensureMainUpToDate
  - Sync mismatch (local \!= origin) still calls die() and aborts wu:done
  - Fetch/network failure still fails open (warn + proceed) — existing policy preserved
  - 'Test: sync mismatch triggers abort (ProcessExitError propagates)'
  - 'Test: network/fetch failure triggers fail-open (warn + continue)'
  - No changes to wu-done-main-sync.ts or wu-done-worktree-services.ts — scope limited to
    wu-done-git-ops.ts
