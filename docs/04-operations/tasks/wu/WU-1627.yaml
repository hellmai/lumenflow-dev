description: Create withAtomicMerge in core to run lane-branch fast-forward merge and push inside an
  ephemeral temp worktree, with bounded merge/push retry and guaranteed cleanup. This WU establishes
  the atomic merge primitive and validates fail-path cleanliness before integration.
acceptance:
  - withAtomicMerge merges lane branch in temp worktree and pushes to origin/main without touching
    live main during risky steps
  - failure-injection tests prove main remains clean on merge failure, push failure, callback
    failure, and retry exhaustion
  - retry-exhaustion errors return clear terminal guidance
