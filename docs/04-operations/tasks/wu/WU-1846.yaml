description: INIT-030 code review found software-delivery manifest.ts has 550+ lines of near-identical tool declaration objects. All 80+ entries follow one of two patterns differing only by name and permission. This should be generated from a compact data structure. Additionally, tool descriptor files in tools/ repeat domain/version/pack fields on every entry.
acceptance:
  - Tool declarations generated from compact TOOL_PERMISSIONS record instead of hand-written objects
  - manifest.ts reduced from 780 lines to 250 lines
  - createToolDescriptor helper auto-fills domain/version/pack fields
  - Existing pack-loader.test.ts manifest sync test still passes
