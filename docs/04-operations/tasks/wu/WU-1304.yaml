description: Audit lumenflow.dev documentation for workflow and command drift, update examples to wu:prep + wu:done flow, correct CLI command names/flags, refresh version/runtime references, and fix broken docs links and weak examples.
acceptance:
  - All pages describing completion now show the wu:prep (worktree gates) then wu:done (main merge) flow, including quickstart, gates, guides, FAQ, and homepage.
  - CLI examples use valid current commands and required flags; unsupported commands (wu:list, wu:escalate, wu-prompt, mem:decide) are removed or replaced.
  - Agent and memory examples use current required args (mem:start --wu, mem:ready --wu, agent:session --wu --tier).
  - Version/runtime references are consistent with current repo tooling (package versions, Node requirement).
  - Previously broken in-site links are corrected or removed, and the A Day example is updated to a realistic multi-task flow.
