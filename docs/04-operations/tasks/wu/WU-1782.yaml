description: 'Problem: evidence receipt->task map can grow unbounded across long runtimes, and lane-lock takeover marker cleanup swallows filesystem errors silently. Add bounded lifecycle cleanup and explicit error logging.'
acceptance:
  - EvidenceStore clears receipt->task mappings when tasks complete (or explicit cleanup API is called).
  - Lane-lock takeover marker cleanup logs I/O failures instead of silent catch blocks.
  - Evidence-store tests demonstrate map growth is bounded across many completed tasks.
