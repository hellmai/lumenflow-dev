description: WU-1218 was supposed to make spec:linter fallback to main CLI dist when worktree CLI is not built, but cli-entry.mjs tries to build instead of falling back. This causes wu:done to fail for docs-only WUs.
acceptance:
  - spec:linter runs successfully in worktrees without built CLI by falling back to main CLI dist
