description: 'Context: wu_create, wu_claim, wu_proto use runCliCommand for WU lifecycle initiation. Problem: 3 shell-out call sites for mutation operations. Solution: register in-process handlers delegating to @lumenflow/core WU lifecycle functions.'
acceptance:
  - wu_create, wu_claim, wu_proto route through runtime.executeTool()
  - runCliCommand is NOT called for any of these 3 tools
  - Full create+claim lifecycle verified end-to-end
