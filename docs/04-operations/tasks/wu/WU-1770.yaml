description: Pack tool registration must be wired from DomainPack manifest declarations into runtime
  resolver paths for production initialization. Scope is manifest-to-runtime resolver wiring only;
  end-to-end integration proof is owned by WU-1774.
acceptance:
  - Runtime provides a default resolver path that converts manifest tool declarations into ToolCapability entries
  - Runtime initialization registers manifest-declared tools without requiring test-only resolver injection
  - Unit tests cover resolver/loader wiring boundaries; e2e ownership remains with WU-1774
