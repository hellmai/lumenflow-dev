description: When handleOrphanCheck calls repairWUInconsistency with projectRoot, the repair function creates its own micro-worktree without pushOnly:true. This nested micro-worktree merges to local main before pushing, causing local main to drift ahead of origin/main after every wu:claim that triggers orphan repair.
acceptance:
  - When projectRoot is provided to repairWUInconsistency, skip micro-worktree creation and work directly on projectRoot
  - Existing wu:repair CLI behavior (no projectRoot) unchanged - still creates micro-worktree
  - After wu:claim with orphan repair, local main equals origin/main (no drift)
  - Add test for nested micro-worktree scenario
