description: "state:doctor --fix has two issues: (1) modifies tracked files (wu-events.jsonl) directly on main without micro-worktree isolation, (2) removes broken events but doesn't update backlog.md/status.md references, leaving stale WU links."
acceptance:
  - state:doctor --fix uses micro-worktree isolation for all tracked file changes
  - state:doctor --fix removes stale WU references from backlog.md and status.md
  - Changes are pushed via merge, not direct file modification
