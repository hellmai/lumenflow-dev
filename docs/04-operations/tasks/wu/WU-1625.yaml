description: WU-1547 removed the dist/* wildcard export from @lumenflow/core, but 8 modules that
  consumers depend on were not added to the explicit exports map. This breaks ExampleApp upgrading
  from 2.15.2 to 2.18.1.
acceptance:
  - All 8 missing modules are added to the exports map in @lumenflow/core/package.json
  - Subpath exports test validates all 8 new exports resolve correctly
