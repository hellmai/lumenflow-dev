description: "Context: lumenflow init scaffolds package.json with format and format:check scripts
  pointing to prettier. Problem: prettier is not installed as part of init. Running pnpm gates
  immediately after init fails on format:check because prettier binary is missing. In Haven test
  project, first 2 gate runs failed before the agent figured out it needed pnpm add -D prettier.
  Other gate stubs (lint, typecheck, cos:gates) correctly exit 0 with guidance messages —
  format:check should do the same. Solution: Either install prettier as part of lumenflow init, or
  make format:check a stub (like lint/typecheck) that exits 0 with a message like '[lumenflow]
  format:check stub -- install prettier to enable this gate'."
acceptance:
  - pnpm gates passes immediately after lumenflow init without manual prettier install
  - format:check either installs prettier or provides a stub like lint/typecheck
  - Stub message guides user to install prettier
