description: initiative:status and orchestrate:init-status currently report done from WU-count aggregation even when initiative YAML status is in_progress and phases are pending. Align status derivation with initiative YAML lifecycle and phase coherence.
acceptance:
  - initiative:status reports in_progress when initiative YAML status is in_progress, even if all currently registered WUs are done.
  - orchestrate:init-status reports in_progress when initiative YAML status is in_progress and phases remain pending.
  - status output includes clear mismatch handling without falsely marking done.
