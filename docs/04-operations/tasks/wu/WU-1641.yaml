title: Fix initiative status commands ignoring initiative YAML status/phase state
lane: 'Framework: CLI Orchestration'
type: bug
status: done
priority: P0
created: 2026-02-13
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/initiative-status.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/orchestrate-init-status.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Set initiative YAML status to in_progress with pending phases and verify both commands do not
      display done.
  unit:
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/__tests__/initiative-status.test.ts
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/__tests__/orchestrate-init-status.test.ts

notes: Added lifecycle-status coherence guards to initiative:status and orchestrate:init-status so
  pending phases prevent false done reporting, with explicit mismatch messaging.

description: initiative:status and orchestrate:init-status currently report done from WU-count
  aggregation even when initiative YAML status is in_progress and phases are pending. Align status
  derivation with initiative YAML lifecycle and phase coherence.
acceptance:
  - initiative:status reports in_progress when initiative YAML status is in_progress, even if all
    currently registered WUs are done.
  - orchestrate:init-status reports in_progress when initiative YAML status is in_progress and
    phases remain pending.
  - status output includes clear mismatch handling without falsely marking done.
