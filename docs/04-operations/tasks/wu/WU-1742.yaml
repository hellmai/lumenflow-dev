    - Run pnpm --filter @lumenflow/core test and confirm status-literal guard + filesystem metrics tests pass.

description: 'Context: WU-1741 gate run still fails on pre-existing core tests observed before completion: status literal guard in core and filesystem metrics adapter expectations. Problem: these failures block wu:prep/wu:done despite WU-1741 lint debt remediation being complete. Solution: remediate status literal usage in dependency-graph/backlog-sync-validator and stabilize filesystem metrics adapter test expectations so pnpm gates test stage passes consistently.'
acceptance:
  - status-literal-guard test passes in @lumenflow/core without regressions.
  - filesystem-metrics.adapter tests pass consistently in gate runs.
  - pnpm gates passes test stage without requiring skip-gates for these failures.
