description: Agents sometimes accidentally work on main instead of their worktree, causing dirty
  state or unwanted commits. Add instruction layer (CLAUDE.md) and enforcement layer (pre-commit
  hook) following industry patterns from GitHub Copilot and Block's Goose.
acceptance:
  - Pre-commit hook blocks commits on main unless LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1
  - CLAUDE.md has 2-line branch safety rule
  - Hook allows commits with [emergency] or [hotfix] in message
  - Hook shows clear error message directing to wu:claim
  - Existing wu:done and pnpm release workflows still work
  - Gates pass
