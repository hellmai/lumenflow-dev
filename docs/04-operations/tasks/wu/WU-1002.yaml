description: |
  Configure @lumenflow/* packages for npm publishing.

  Context: LumenFlow is now self-hosted with working workflow (Phase 1 complete).
  Problem: Packages can't be published to npm without proper configuration.
  Solution: Add publishConfig to all 7 packages, setup changesets for versioning.
acceptance:
  - "All 7 @lumenflow/* packages have publishConfig with access: restricted"
  - "Changesets initialized with .changeset/config.json"
  - "Release scripts added to root package.json (prerelease, release, version)"
  - "pnpm changeset works without errors"
  - pnpm format, lint, typecheck → PASS
