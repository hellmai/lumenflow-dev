  homepage jumps to technical architecture before explaining the problem LumenFlow solves.
  Restructure to follow problem → solution → credibility → features → get started flow.

  - Astro 6 beta builds successfully with all 71 pages
  - Homepage leads with problem/pain before technical details
  - Primary CTA is learn-first not CLI setup
  - Four Guarantees section appears after problem statement
  - Deployed to production
