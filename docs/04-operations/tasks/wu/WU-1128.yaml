description: 'Users need clear upgrade instructions on lumenflow.dev. Currently no dedicated upgrade
  page exists. With 2.1.0 released, users need to know how to upgrade all 7 @lumenflow packages.
  Should document: (1) using lumenflow:upgrade command (after WU-1127 fix), (2) manual pnpm up
  workaround, (3) post-upgrade docs:sync step. Also update changelog to show 2.1.0 as latest.'
acceptance:
  - Dedicated upgrade guide page at /getting-started/upgrade
  - Documents lumenflow:upgrade --latest command
  - Documents manual upgrade fallback (pnpm up)
  - Documents post-upgrade docs:sync --force step
  - Changelog updated to show 2.1.0 as latest
  - Compatibility matrix shows 2.1.0 versions
  - Upgrade page linked in Getting Started nav
