description: 'Context: after completing 3 WUs in Haven test, both backlog.md and status.md show
  empty sections. Problem: state events exist in wu-events.jsonl but arent reflected in rendered
  markdown. May be a local-only mode path issue or a rendering bug in wu:done/wu:claim. Solution:
  fix markdown regeneration to reflect actual state.'
acceptance:
  - After wu:done, backlog.md shows the completed WU in the Done section
  - After wu:claim, status.md shows the claimed WU in the In Progress section
  - Both files render correctly from wu-events.jsonl in local-only mode
