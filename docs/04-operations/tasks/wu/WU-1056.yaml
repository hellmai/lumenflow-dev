risks:
  - Overly strict cleanup could block legitimate cleanup when merge evidence is missing
notes: 'Triggered by WU-1052 incident: unsafe cleanup deleted in-progress work. Escalate if cleanup
  would remove a worktree without stamp+done or with uncommitted/unpushed work.'

description: Harden wu:cleanup to prevent worktree data loss and add vendor-agnostic safeguards when
  worktrees disappear outside tooling. The prior merge-base fallback allowed deletion of in-progress
  work; this adds strict safety checks and recovery visibility.
acceptance:
  - wu:cleanup refuses deletion when worktree has uncommitted changes
  - wu:cleanup refuses deletion when worktree has unpushed commits
  - wu:cleanup requires WU YAML status=done and stamp file exists before deletion
  - If gh CLI is available, wu:cleanup requires PR merged; no merge-base fallback
  - If gh CLI is unavailable, wu:cleanup still refuses without stamp+done
  - Missing worktree directories for claimed WUs trigger a warning/incident
  - Safeguards covered by unit tests
