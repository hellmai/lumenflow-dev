description: 'Context: sync validation logic is split across wu-helpers and wu-done-main-sync
  modules. Problem: duplicated implementations increase drift risk and obscure the canonical sync
  contract. Solution: add a dedicated sync-validator module that centralizes shared sync-validation
  functions and keep compatibility re-exports in existing modules to avoid breaking consumers.'
acceptance:
  - Add core sync-validator module that hosts canonical sync validation helpers used across wu
    helpers and wu:done paths
  - Keep backward compatibility by re-exporting legacy symbols from existing modules during migration
  - Preserve existing runtime behavior and error surfaces for existing call sites
  - Core sync tests pass after module extraction
