description: Once software-delivery handlers are fully migrated, temporary compatibility behavior
  must be tightened back to fail-closed defaults. This WU turns migration fallback off by default,
  removes software-delivery fallback shims, and keeps only intentional escape hatches required for
  emergency rollback during the stabilization window.
acceptance:
  - Migration compatibility guard defaults to strict mode for software-delivery command execution
  - Software-delivery fallback shim handlers are removed from runtime resolver
  - Regression tests verify migrated software-delivery commands no longer rely on CLI fallback
