description: When an agent is interrupted mid-WU, no complete event is recorded. The WU becomes stuck in in_progress state with no recovery path. Need a wu:release command that adds a release event type to allow reclaiming orphaned WUs.
acceptance:
  - Add release event type to wu-state-schema.ts
  - wu:release command appends release event transitioning WU from in_progress to ready
  - State store handles release event correctly on replay
  - Cannot release a WU that is not in_progress
