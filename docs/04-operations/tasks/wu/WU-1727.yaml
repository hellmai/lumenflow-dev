description: 'Context: INIT-029 Phase 1 — Kernel Foundation. Depends on WU-1725 (schemas) and WU-1726 (EventStore). Problem: The kernel needs a configurable state machine for task lifecycle transitions. Current state-machine.ts is 95 lines of hardcoded transitions. Solution: XState v5 machine definition for ready->active->blocked->waiting->done (already installed at ^5.28.0). Pack-registerable state aliases (e.g. software-delivery maps active to in_progress). assertTransition() wrapper for validation. Integration test: full task lifecycle (create workspace -> create task -> claim -> run_start -> run_succeed -> complete -> verify projected state from events). Reference: state-machine.ts, xstate docs. Plan: .claude/plans/golden-prancing-cookie.md'
acceptance:
  - XState v5 machine definition for ready->active->blocked->waiting->done transitions
  - active->blocked, active->waiting, active->done, active->ready (release) transitions work
  - blocked->active, blocked->done, waiting->active, waiting->done transitions work
  - done is terminal — all transitions from done are rejected
  - 'Pack-registerable state aliases (e.g. {active: in_progress}) resolve correctly'
  - assertTransition() wrapper throws on illegal transitions with descriptive errors
  - 'Integration test: full lifecycle create->claim->run_start->run_succeed->complete->verify projected state'
  - State machine is serializable (XState snapshot/restore)
