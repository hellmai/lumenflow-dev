description: 'Context: runtime hard cut is complete, but a few live documentation/config surfaces still mention the removed .lumenflow.config.yaml name. Problem: these mentions undermine kernel-first clarity and can confuse new readers. Solution: remove remaining live-surface mentions, keep historical WU records intact, and add a regression guard covering active docs/config surfaces.'
acceptance:
  - workspace.yaml no longer references .lumenflow.config.yaml in lanes or active configuration.
  - Current public-facing docs/config surfaces no longer mention .lumenflow.config.yaml.
  - A regression test guards active docs/config surfaces against reintroducing the removed filename while excluding historical task records.
