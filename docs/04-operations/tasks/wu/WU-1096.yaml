description: 'Fix minor bugs discovered in WU-1090 code review: (1) Recovery analyzer suggests non-existent wu:cleanup and wu:repair commands (2) DETACHED location type is defined but never returned by location-resolver.ts. Shell escaping fix moved to WU-1097 (CLI lane).'
acceptance:
  - Recovery analyzer suggests wu:recover --action X instead of wu:cleanup/wu:repair
  - DETACHED location type detected and returned when HEAD is detached
  - Unit tests cover both fixes
