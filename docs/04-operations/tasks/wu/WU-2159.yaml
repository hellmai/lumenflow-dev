  ## Implementation notes


  ### Reference files

  - Port interface: packages/@lumenflow/control-plane-sdk/src/sync-port.ts (7 methods, all async)

  - Mock reference: packages/@lumenflow/control-plane-sdk/src/mock/mock-control-plane-sync-port.ts

  - Sync loop consumer: packages/@lumenflow/surfaces/http/control-plane-event-subscriber.ts
  (runSyncCycle: pullPolicies → heartbeat → pushKernelEvents)

  - Runtime wiring point: apps/web/src/server/http-surface-runtime.ts
  (readWorkspaceControlPlaneConfig + getControlPlaneDiagnostics)

  - Existing tests: packages/@lumenflow/surfaces/__tests__/control-plane-forwarding.test.ts
  (patterns for vi.useFakeTimers, mock port)

  - Config schema: packages/@lumenflow/control-plane-sdk/src/workspace-config.ts
  (ControlPlaneConfigSchema)


  ### Test workspace (for integration smoke test)

  - Endpoint: https://cloud.lumenflow.dev

  - Org ID: 10762bb6-1bf2-4c15-aa13-c4fd20bbc7b9

  - API key env: LUMENFLOW_CLOUD_TOKEN

  - Tier: Team (trialing)


  ### Architecture

  - HttpControlPlaneSyncPort goes in packages/@lumenflow/control-plane-sdk/src/http/ (mirrors mock/
  directory pattern)

  - Export from index.ts alongside MockControlPlaneSyncPort

  - Factory function: createHttpControlPlaneSyncPort(config: WorkspaceControlPlaneConfig, logger?:
  Pick<Console, 'warn'>)

  - Use native fetch() — no axios/got/undici dependency

  - ControlPlaneSyncPortLike (minimal interface used by HTTP Surface) is a subset of full
  ControlPlaneSyncPort — the HTTP adapter implements the full interface

  - Runtime wiring MUST pass both controlPlaneSyncPort and workspaceId to createHttpSurface;
  forwarding is not activated without workspaceId

  - Runtime wiring SHOULD pass controlPlaneSyncIntervalMs from control_plane.sync_interval (seconds
  -> milliseconds)


  ### Scope clarification

  - This WU covers runtime control-plane sync for kernel event stream forwarding (pullPolicies →
  heartbeat → pushKernelEvents)

  - This WU does NOT implement NDJSON tailing/shipping for .lumenflow/telemetry/*.ndjson or
  .lumenflow/flow.log produced by pnpm gates / CLI telemetry emitters

  - NDJSON file sync is a follow-up scope (separate WU) to satisfy onboarding flows that only run
  CLI gates


  ### Graceful degradation pattern

  - Wrap every fetch() in try/catch

  - On network error/non-2xx/timeout: logger.warn() with context

  - For pullPolicies/heartbeat/pushKernelEvents: rethrow after logging so
  wrapEventSubscriberWithControlPlaneSync can emit diagnostics and preserve retry/requeue behavior
  (no silent event loss)

  - For auxiliary methods not used by sync loop today
  (pullConfig/pushTelemetry/pushEvidence/authenticate): return safe defaults when feasible

  - Local operations must remain fail-open because caller layers already catch sync failures and
  continue serving local workflows

  ## Context


  The workspace.yaml control_plane: block is written by lumenflow cloud:connect, and the
  ControlPlaneSyncPort interface exists with a mock implementation — but no HTTP adapter exists to
  actually call the Cloud REST API for runtime event forwarding.


  ## Problem


  Dogfooding the lumenflow-cloud onboarding guide shows that cloud connection setup works, but
  runtime control-plane forwarding is still mock-only because no HTTP sync implementation exists.
  The port interface, mock, sync loop (in control-plane-event-subscriber.ts), and config schema are
  all in place — only the production adapter is missing.


  ## Solution


  Implement HttpControlPlaneSyncPort in @lumenflow/control-plane-sdk that maps the 7 port methods to
  Cloud REST API endpoints using native fetch(). Wire it into the web app runtime so that when
  control_plane: config is present in workspace.yaml, the real adapter is instantiated and injected
  into the HTTP Surface with workspaceId and sync interval wiring.


  ### Cloud REST API mapping


  | Port Method | Cloud Endpoint | Auth |

  |---|---|---|

  | authenticate() | POST /api/v1/authenticate | Bearer <api-key> |

  | heartbeat() | POST /api/v1/heartbeat | Bearer <api-key> |

  | pushKernelEvents() | POST /api/v1/events | Bearer <api-key> |

  | pushEvidence() | POST /api/v1/evidence | Bearer <api-key> |

  | pushTelemetry() | POST /api/v1/telemetry | Bearer <api-key> |

  | pullPolicies() | POST /api/v1/policies (or GET) | Bearer <api-key> |

  | pullConfig() | POST /api/v1/config (or GET) | Bearer <api-key> |


  Auth: reads API key from process.env[control_plane.auth.token_env], sends as Authorization: Bearer
  header.


  ### Key constraints


  - Graceful degradation: if Cloud is unreachable or returns errors, log warnings and NEVER block
  local operations

  - Do not silently drop event batches: sync-loop-facing methods must propagate failure to caller so
  existing retry/requeue logic remains effective

  - Use native fetch() (Node 18+), no external HTTP library

  - Follow MockControlPlaneSyncPort as reference implementation pattern

  - Respect existing sync loop in control-plane-event-subscriber.ts (pullPolicies → heartbeat →
  pushKernelEvents cycle)

  - Non-goal for this WU: NDJSON file shipping for gates/flow telemetry logs
acceptance:
  - HttpControlPlaneSyncPort class implements ControlPlaneSyncPort interface with all 7 methods
    mapping to Cloud REST API endpoints via native fetch()
  - Constructor accepts WorkspaceControlPlaneConfig and reads API key from
    process.env[config.auth.token_env]
  - 'All HTTP calls include Authorization: Bearer <api-key> header and Content-Type:
    application/json'
  - For pullPolicies/heartbeat/pushKernelEvents, network/non-2xx/timeout failures are logged and
    rethrown so control-plane-event-subscriber can emit diagnostics and preserve retry/requeue
    semantics
  - For pullConfig/pushTelemetry/pushEvidence/authenticate, failures are logged and return safe
    defaults where possible
  - Request timeout configurable (default 10s) to prevent hanging on unresponsive cloud endpoints
  - 'Runtime wiring in http-surface-runtime.ts: when control_plane config is present and valid,
    instantiate HttpControlPlaneSyncPort and inject into HttpSurface options with workspaceId'
  - Runtime wiring uses control_plane.sync_interval (seconds) to configure controlPlaneSyncIntervalMs
  - Runtime wiring falls back safely (no control-plane injection) when workspace id or control_plane
    config is missing/invalid
  - 'Unit tests cover all 7 methods with msw or nock HTTP mocking: success path, error path (network
    failure), error path (non-2xx response), and timeout'
  - 'Integration smoke test: authenticate() against test workspace endpoint returns valid
    ControlPlaneIdentity (can be skipped in CI via env flag)'
  - 'Non-goal explicitly verified: this WU does not claim pnpm gates NDJSON file shipping to cloud
    dashboard'
