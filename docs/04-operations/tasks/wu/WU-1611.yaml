description: 'Context: wu:done can leave main dirty after completion when metadata files are modified post-merge. Problem: wu:done attempts an auto-commit of metadata files on main, but pre-commit blocks direct main commits, leaving files like .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl dirty. Solution: remove direct-main auto-commit path and enforce clean-main restoration/error handling with targeted tests.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done does not attempt a direct commit on main for post-merge metadata files
  - if metadata files are dirty post-merge, wu:done restores or fails without leaving main dirty
  - existing lifecycle behavior remains unchanged for non-metadata and internal files
