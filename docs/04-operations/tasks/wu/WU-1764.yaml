description: 'Kernel is disconnected from package graph — no existing package declares it as dependency. Missing sub-path exports for pack, policy, sandbox modules. Multiple DRY violations: isRunLifecycleEvent (2x), buildFailureOutput (3x), withScopeNote (2x), SEMVER_REGEX (2x), buildRunHistory (2x). Missing README.md and LICENSE files listed in package.json files array.'
acceptance:
  - Kernel wired into package graph with proper dependency declarations
  - Missing sub-path exports added to barrel and package.json exports map
  - DRY violations extracted into shared utilities
  - README.md and LICENSE files created for kernel package
