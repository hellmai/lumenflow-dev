notes: Rely on micro-worktree retry (p-retry in core) for non-fast-forward handling; CLI should

description: Add CLI-level handling/tests for initiative:add-wu and initiative:remove-wu when
  origin/main moves mid-operation. Should rely on micro-worktree retry and surface clear errors if
  still failing.
acceptance:
  - initiative:add-wu succeeds when origin/main moves (retry path)
  - initiative:remove-wu succeeds when origin/main moves (retry path)
  - If retries exhausted, error message includes next steps
