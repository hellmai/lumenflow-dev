title: Fix failing core tests for tslib resolution and consumer integration timeout
lane: 'Framework: Core'

  manual:
    - Run pnpm --filter @lumenflow/core test and verify no tslib errors

notes: Added tslib as devDependency to resolve memfs transitive peer dep. Added explicit timeout
  constants (SETUP_TIMEOUT_MS=30s, COMMAND_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS=15s) to consumer-integration tests to
  prevent flaky failures from network-dependent npm install and CLI command execution.

description: 'Context: root pnpm test currently fails in @lumenflow/core due to missing tslib at
  runtime in wu-list.test.ts and a beforeAll hook timeout in consumer-integration.test.ts. Problem:
  test signal is red and blocks reliable gate execution. Solution: correct dependency/runtime setup
  for memfs/tslib and stabilize or re-scope the long-running consumer integration test timeout
  behavior.'
acceptance:
  - pnpm --filter @lumenflow/core test passes without wu-list tslib module errors
  - consumer-integration test setup no longer times out during default test runs
  - Root pnpm test no longer fails due to @lumenflow/core suite
