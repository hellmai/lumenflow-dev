description: 'Context: root pnpm test currently fails in @lumenflow/core due to missing tslib at runtime in wu-list.test.ts and a beforeAll hook timeout in consumer-integration.test.ts. Problem: test signal is red and blocks reliable gate execution. Solution: correct dependency/runtime setup for memfs/tslib and stabilize or re-scope the long-running consumer integration test timeout behavior.'
acceptance:
  - pnpm --filter @lumenflow/core test passes without wu-list tslib module errors
  - consumer-integration test setup no longer times out during default test runs
  - Root pnpm test no longer fails due to @lumenflow/core suite
