description: Initiatives can be created with empty description, phases, success_metrics. WUs can
  link to incomplete initiatives. Initiative status stays draft even as WUs complete. Validation
  parity with WU creation is needed.
acceptance:
  - initiative:create warns if description not provided
  - wu:create --initiative INIT-XXX warns if initiative has no phases defined
  - 'Initiative status auto-progresses: draft to in_progress when first WU claimed'
  - state:doctor reports incomplete initiatives
