description: Replace branch-only non-PR live-main merge and metadata-on-main writes with withAtomicMerge using an afterMerge callback in temp worktree. Add idempotent rerun and branch-only integration coverage to prove convergence under origin movement without dirty-main side effects.
acceptance:
  - branch-only non-PR completion path uses withAtomicMerge with afterMerge callback
  - idempotent rerun after injected partial failure succeeds without duplicate metadata/events
  - branch-only integration verifies clean main and retry convergence under origin movement
