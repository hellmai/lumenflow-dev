description: 'Context: the repo is published as open source, but key contributor governance surfaces are missing. Problem: missing CODE_OF_CONDUCT/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY guidance and issue/PR templates creates friction and unclear support/security intake for external contributors. Solution: add .github-scoped community health docs and templates aligned with current workflow and release model.'
acceptance:
  - Add .github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, .github/CONTRIBUTING.md, and .github/SECURITY.md with project-specific contribution, behavior, and disclosure guidance.
  - Add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md and .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md with fields that route reports to actionable reproduction details.
  - Add .github/pull_request_template.md that requests WU linkage, validation evidence, and docs impact notes.
  - README.md includes a short contributor section linking to the new .github governance docs.
  - Documentation checks and project gates pass without introducing workflow drift.
