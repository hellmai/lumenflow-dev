description: 'Context: micro-worktree formatting emits a noisy warning when prettier is not installed. Problem: wu:create and other commands show confusing errors during onboarding. Solution: detect missing prettier before formatting and emit a clear, actionable message (or skip silently).'
acceptance:
  - formatFiles skips formatting when prettier is not available without throwing
  - Warning message is clear and actionable if formatting is skipped
  - Unit tests cover missing-prettier behavior
