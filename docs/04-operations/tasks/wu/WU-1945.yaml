description: Apply existing input-validation guards uniformly across write endpoints so path traversal, null-byte, CSRF, and oversized-body checks are enforced consistently before any filesystem or pack write operations.
acceptance:
  - All write endpoints enforce path traversal and null-byte validation using shared validators
  - CSRF and body-size protections are applied consistently on install/create/authoring write routes
  - Security regression tests cover encoded traversal and cross-origin attempts
