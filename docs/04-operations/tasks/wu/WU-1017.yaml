notes: |
  Sublane configuration gap: Infrastructure lane should have sublanes
  (e.g., CI/CD, Developer-Tooling, Hooks) but .lumenflow.lane-inference.yaml
  doesn't exist yet. Sublane enforcement not active. Consider follow-up WU.

description: |
  Implement vendor-agnostic git workflow enforcement via Husky hooks.

  Context: The playbook (lines 477-516) documents git hooks that don't exist.
  Currently only Claude Code has enforcement via .claude/hooks/validate-worktree-path.sh.
  Non-Claude agents can bypass workflow enforcement entirely.

  Problem:
  - Direct commits to main are possible when no worktrees exist
  - ff-only merges can bypass main protection with bad commit messages
  - Documentation claims hooks exist but they don't

  Solution: Node.js hooks via Husky with these features:
  - pre-commit: Block direct commits to main/master, respect Branch-Only mode
  - commit-msg: Validate format on main, require WU ID on lane branches
  - prepare-commit-msg: Auto-inject WU ID prefix from branch name
  - pre-push: Block direct push to main, allow all lane pushes (WU-1255)
  - All hooks skip tmp/* branches (micro-worktree support)
  - LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 escape hatch
  - Track .husky/ in git for worktree compatibility
acceptance:
  - Husky installed with prepare script
  - .husky/ tracked in git including .husky/_/husky.sh
  - All hooks skip tmp/* branches
  - pre-commit blocks direct commits to main/master
  - pre-commit allows Branch-Only mode (checks claimed_mode)
  - commit-msg validates format on main using regex patterns
  - commit-msg requires WU ID in lane branch messages
  - prepare-commit-msg auto-injects WU ID from branch
  - pre-push blocks direct push to main/master
  - pre-push allows ALL lane branch pushes (per WU-1255)
  - Hooks run correctly inside worktrees/* directories
  - LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 bypasses all hooks
  - Playbook docs updated to match implementation
  - pnpm format, lint, typecheck → PASS
