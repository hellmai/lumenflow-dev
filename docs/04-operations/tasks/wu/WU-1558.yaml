description: 'Context: INIT-020 WU-1541 removed process.chdir from wu-done-worktree.ts. Problem:
  gates.ts:1395-1413 still has a save/restore process.chdir pattern for gate execution in
  non-default cwd. Solution: Pass explicit cwd through executeGates options instead of mutating
  global state.'
acceptance:
  - gates.ts no longer calls process.chdir in production code
  - Gate execution uses explicit cwd option passed through the call chain
  - All existing gate tests pass after changes
