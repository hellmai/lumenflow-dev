description: Detect orphaned WUs, dangling signals, broken memory relationships. Inspired by Beads bd doctor command. Provide --fix for safe auto-repair.
acceptance:
  - CLI command pnpm state:doctor runs all integrity checks
  - Detects orphaned WUs (done status but no stamp)
  - Detects dangling signals (reference non-existent WUs)
  - Detects broken memory relationships and events for missing WU specs
  - --fix flag auto-repairs safe issues (e.g., remove dangling signals)
  - Human-readable output with actionable suggestions
