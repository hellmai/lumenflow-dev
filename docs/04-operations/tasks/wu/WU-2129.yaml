description: 'The Starlight initiatives guide (guides/initiatives.mdx and packs/software-delivery/advanced/initiatives.mdx) covers creation, lifecycle, and basic orchestration but is missing: (1) failure recovery playbook (escalation levels, stuck agent handling, recovery commands), (2) memory coordination patterns (mem:signal/mem:inbox between waves), (3) delegation lineage (wu:delegate, delegation:list), (4) checkpoint-per-wave mechanics (manifest location, idempotent re-runs). The orchestration skill has this content but it is agent-internal only. Also need an internal agent onboarding doc tying the pieces together.'
acceptance:
  - Starlight initiatives guide includes Failure Recovery section with escalation levels and recovery commands
  - Starlight initiatives guide includes Memory Coordination section covering mem:signal and mem:inbox patterns
  - Starlight initiatives guide includes Delegation section covering wu:delegate and delegation:list
  - Starlight initiatives guide checkpoint section explains manifest location and idempotent re-runs
  - Internal agent onboarding doc exists at docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/initiative-orchestration.md
  - Both Starlight files (guides/ and packs/) are updated consistently
