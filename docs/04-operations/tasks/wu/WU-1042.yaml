description: 'Context: Gates failures often require manual investigation (format errors), and
  worktrees can accumulate build artifacts that break builds (TS5055). Problem: gates output doesn’t
  always surface the exact fix command, and there’s no first-class cleanup helper for worktree dist
  artifacts. Solution: improve gates error messaging for format:check (print exact prettier command
  with file list) and add a CLI cleanup helper to remove build artifacts in a worktree safely,
  documented for agents.'
acceptance:
  - When format:check fails in gates, output includes the exact prettier --write command and
    affected file paths
  - New CLI helper can safely remove dist artifacts in the current worktree
  - Docs updated with new cleanup helper usage
