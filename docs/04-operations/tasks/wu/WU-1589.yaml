description: 'Context: Branch-pr cloud agents need first-class lifecycle support but core metadata and branch resolution still assume lane-derived local workflows. Problem: branch-pr flows cannot reliably resolve actual branches or pass commit hooks, and reset paths can leave stale claim metadata. Solution: add claimed_branch as canonical branch metadata, prioritize it in shared branch resolution, allow branch-pr in pre-commit gating, and harden rollback/release/recover cleanup semantics.'
acceptance:
  - Add claimed_branch to WU schema and preserve backward compatibility for legacy WUs.
  - Update defaultBranchFrom() to prefer claimed_branch and fall back to lane-derived naming.
  - Allow pre-commit lane-branch commits when claimed_mode is branch-pr.
  - Ensure rollback/release/recover clear both claimed_mode and claimed_branch when resetting to ready.
  - Add/extend tests for schema, resolver precedence, and branch-pr hook behavior.
