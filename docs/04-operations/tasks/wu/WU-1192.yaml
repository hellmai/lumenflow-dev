description: Two wu-spawn.ts files exist (CLI and Core) with diverged prompt templates. CLI has
  authoritative version with LUMENFLOW_SPAWN_END sentinel and SKIP-GATES AUTONOMY constraint. Core
  version (used by orchestrator) is missing these. Refactor to single source of truth in Core, with
  CLI as thin wrapper.
acceptance:
  - Prompt template content lives in @lumenflow/core only
  - CLI wu-spawn.ts is thin wrapper calling core
  - orchestrate:initiative output matches wu:spawn output (same sentinel, same constraints)
  - No duplicate prompt template content between packages
