title: state:doctor should detect stale status/backlog references for non-active WUs
lane: 'Framework: Core State Recovery'
type: bug
status: done
priority: P1
created: 2026-03-01

tests:
  manual:
    - Seed status.md In Progress with a superseded WU and verify state:doctor flags it, then verify
      state:doctor --fix removes it

notes: Added stale In Progress reference detection in state-doctor core (status.md/backlog.md
  sections), and CLI --fix reconciliation that regenerates status/backlog from WUStateStore in
  micro-worktree isolation.

description: 'Context: operators rely on state:doctor as the primary health check before claim and
  recovery actions. Problem: stale status.md/backlog entries can still list WUs as in progress even
  when YAML/state indicate non-active status, but state:doctor may report healthy or unrelated
  issues only, leaving lane-blocking drift undetected. Solution: extend diagnostics to explicitly
  flag stale status/backlog references that contradict canonical WU status and provide a fix path
  that regenerates affected docs from the state store.'
acceptance:
  - state:doctor reports stale In Progress references when referenced WU status is superseded, done,
    or cancelled
  - state:doctor reports stale backlog references that contradict canonical WU status
  - --fix regenerates status/backlog so stale references are removed
  - regression tests cover stale WU references and successful fix behavior
  - pnpm gates passes
