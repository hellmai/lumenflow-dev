description: 'Repair post-initiative regressions that break enforcement integrity: a reintroduced
  throw new Error() in path-factory trips the WU-2111 ratchet baseline, and
  wu-inconsistency-repairer unit expectations are stale against the current createStampInWorktree
  contract. Fix both so guardrails remain trustworthy and core tests are stable.'
acceptance:
  - Path factory unknown-key handling uses structured createError/ErrorCodes semantics instead of
    raw Error construction
  - Throw-new-error ratchet guard remains non-regressed at baseline zero
  - WU inconsistency repairer tests assert the current createStampInWorktree call contract and
    remain isolated from stale mock call history
  - Targeted core enforcement and repairer test suite passes
