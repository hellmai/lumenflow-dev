description: WU-1626 refactor imported ./micro-worktree-shared.js from micro-worktree.ts but did not
  commit packages/@lumenflow/core/src/micro-worktree-shared.ts, breaking @lumenflow/core typecheck
  and downstream CLI builds on main.
acceptance:
  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/micro-worktree-shared.ts exists and exports the shared helper
    surface required by micro-worktree.ts
  - pnpm --filter @lumenflow/core typecheck passes
  - pnpm build --filter=@lumenflow/cli passes from main
