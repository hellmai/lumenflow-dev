description: pushOnly path in micro-worktree currently bypasses retry/rebase and fails on non-fast-forward. Add retry handling (with p-retry) for pushRefspecWithForce so initiative:add/remove-wu and other push-only commands recover when origin moves.
acceptance:
  - push-only path retries on non-fast-forward with rebase + re-merge
  - Uses git.push_retry config (enabled/retries/min/max/jitter)
  - Still uses LUMENFLOW_FORCE for refspec push
  - Clear error after retries exhausted
