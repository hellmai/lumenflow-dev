description: Sub-agents can leave dirty state on main after wu:done. When pnpm format touches files
  outside the WU code_paths, those changes remain uncommitted after worktree cleanup. wu:done should
  detect and fail on this.
acceptance:
  - wu:done fails with clear error if main has uncommitted changes after merge
  - Error message lists the dirty files
  - All existing wu:done tests pass
