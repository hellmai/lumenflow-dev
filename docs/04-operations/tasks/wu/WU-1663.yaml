description: 'Context: wu:done CLI currently mixes orchestration, transition logic, and fallback
  flow decisions in a monolithic execution path. Problem: implicit transitions and duplicated
  control logic make behavior hard to validate and evolve safely. Solution: refactor wu:done CLI
  orchestration to drive execution via the typed XState pipeline machine while preserving current
  public CLI contract and the existing preCommitGateDecision + markGatesPassed baseline semantics
  from WU-1659.'
acceptance:
  - wu-done orchestrator delegates transition flow to the XState pipeline actor while preserving
    existing command flags/output semantics.
  - Pre-commit gate behavior remains aligned with current baseline (preCommitGateDecision decision
    path plus markGatesPassed checkpoint semantics).
  - Existing wu:done unit/integration tests pass without behavioral regressions on happy-path and
    failure-path entry points.
  - Orchestrator complexity is reduced with clear state-driven flow boundaries for subsequent
    rollback migration WUs.
  - Legacy rollback mechanisms (rollbackTransaction, zombie recovery) remain active and functional;
    this WU does NOT remove or disable them.
