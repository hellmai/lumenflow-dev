description: >-
  Context: wu:done pre-flight validation runs validateAllPreCommitHooks() which executes the
  gates-pre-commit script in the consuming repo's tools/ directory.


  Problem: Line 222 of wu-done-preflight.ts hardcodes 'node tools/gates-pre-commit.js' but
  downstream repos may use .mjs extension for ES modules. This causes wu:done to fail when only a
  .mjs file exists. Documentation in 5 files references .mjs but execution uses .js.


  Solution: Check for .mjs first using existsSync (already used elsewhere in core), fall back to .js
  for backwards compatibility.
acceptance:
  - validateAllPreCommitHooks() checks for .mjs extension first, falls back to .js
  - Backwards compatible - repos with .js gate scripts continue to work
  - New support - repos with .mjs gate scripts now work
  - Unit test covers both extension resolution paths
