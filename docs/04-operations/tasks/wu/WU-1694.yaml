code_paths:

tests:
  manual:
    - Run pnpm --filter @lumenflow/cli exec tsc --noEmit --strictNullChecks true --noImplicitAny
      true --useUnknownInCatchVariables true --pretty false and confirm TS7006 is absent for
      wu-claim-state.ts and wu-claim-validation.ts.
    - Run pnpm --filter @lumenflow/cli test -- wu-claim.test.ts and confirm claim behavior remains
      unchanged.

description: 'Context: strict debt remains high (1,315 errors) with TS7006 as the dominant class.
  Problem: packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-claim-state.ts and wu-claim-validation.ts are top TS7006
  hotspots and block noImplicitAny progress. Solution: apply type-safe parameter annotations and
  small extraction where needed to remove TS7006 in these two files without behavior changes, using
  tests-first coverage for claim-validation/state behaviors.'
acceptance:
  - Targeted strict run reports 0 TS7006 errors in packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-claim-state.ts
  - Targeted strict run reports 0 TS7006 errors in packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-claim-validation.ts
  - wu-claim command unit tests continue to pass
  - No functional behavior change in claim status/validation logic (covered by added or updated
    tests)
