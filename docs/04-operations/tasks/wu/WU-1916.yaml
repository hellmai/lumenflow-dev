description: Homepage Get Started button points to agent-only quickstart. Why LumenFlow page
  positions it as a delivery methodology. 14 concept/guide pages present Software Delivery Pack
  features as core LumenFlow. Fix all content to reflect kernel/pack architecture, provide dual
  human/agent entry paths.
acceptance:
  - Homepage shows dual Get Started (Humans) and Agent Quickstart CTAs
  - Why LumenFlow page discusses governance kernel not methodology
  - Pack overview page contains methodology comparison with working links
  - All pack concept/guide pages have Aside clarifying Software Delivery Pack content
  - Sidebar shows renamed entry labels for human/agent paths
  - Site builds without errors
