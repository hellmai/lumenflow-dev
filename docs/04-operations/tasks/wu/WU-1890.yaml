description: Final software-delivery migration pass must remove residual pending handlers across
  file, git, state, validation, and lane surfaces and reconcile manifest/resolver coverage. This WU
  completes that migration and drives pendingRuntimeMigrationTool usage for software-delivery to
  zero.
acceptance:
  - File, git, state, validation, and lane command families are implemented by software-delivery
    handlers
  - software-delivery manifest contains no pendingRuntimeMigrationTool entries
  - Resolver does not register fallback-only handler stubs for software-delivery command surfaces
