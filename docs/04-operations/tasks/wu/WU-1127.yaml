description: "REAL USER IMPACT: ExampleApp agent tried to upgrade to 2.1.0 and hit massive friction
  - hook blocked pnpm up on main, had to create WU (3 attempts), claim failed once, virtual store
  issues, etc. All just to upgrade packages\\! The lumenflow:upgrade command requires users to be
  inside a worktree but doesn't use micro-worktree isolation. This creates a paradox: users must
  break LumenFlow rules to upgrade LumenFlow. Command should use micro-worktree like
  wu:create/wu:edit do."
acceptance:
  - lumenflow:upgrade uses micro-worktree isolation pattern
  - Command runs from main checkout without requiring user worktree
  - Changes to package.json and lockfile are atomic via micro-worktree
  - Existing --dry-run and --latest flags still work
  - Unit tests verify micro-worktree behavior
