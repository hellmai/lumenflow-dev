description: 'Context: 100+ bare status strings, duplicated MEMORY_DIR/SIGNALS_FILE/NodeFsError, and 40+ hardcoded docs/04-operations/tasks paths exist across the codebase. Problem: duplicated literals drift and increase maintenance risk. Solution: replace bare status strings with WU_STATUS.* constants, consolidate duplicated local constants, replace task directory paths with DIRECTORIES.WU_DIR.'
acceptance:
  - Bare status string literals replaced with WU_STATUS.* constants in production code.
  - Duplicated MEMORY_DIR, SIGNALS_FILE, and NodeFsError definitions consolidated to single shared sources.
  - Hardcoded docs/04-operations/tasks paths replaced with DIRECTORIES.WU_DIR where available.
