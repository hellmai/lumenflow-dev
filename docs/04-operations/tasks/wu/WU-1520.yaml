description: 'Context: gates hard-fail when format:check, spec:linter, lint, or typecheck scripts are missing. Problem: new/simple projects that havent configured all tools get ERR_PNPM_NO_SCRIPT failures. Solution: if a gate script doesnt exist in package.json, emit warning and skip instead of failing. Add --strict flag for CI enforcement.'
acceptance:
  - Missing gate scripts cause a warning and skip, not a hard failure
  - Warning message includes how to add the missing script
  - Invariants check is never skippable
  - --strict flag makes missing scripts a hard failure for CI
  - Gate summary shows which gates were skipped vs passed vs failed
