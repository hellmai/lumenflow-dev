  Sizing: Simple. Strategy: Single Session.


  Robust fix: add operation-level push-retry override and improve retry exhaustion guidance (suggest
  git.push_retry tuning). Maintain cleanup guarantees.

description: >-
  Context: initiative:add-wu uses micro-worktrees.

  Problem: If push-only fails, temp worktree/branch can be left orphaned and subsequent runs fail.

  Solution: Ensure cleanup removes temp worktree/branch even when push fails and surface actionable
  recovery.
acceptance:
  - initiative:add-wu cleans temp worktree/branch on failure
  - Retry exhaustion message includes guidance to increase git.push_retry or wait before retry
  - initiative:add-wu can use an operation-level push retry override (higher retries/backoff)
  - Retrying initiative:add-wu after failure succeeds without manual git worktree remove
