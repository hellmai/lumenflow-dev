description: Mechanically split packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-spawn.ts into prompt-builder and
  strategy-resolution modules while keeping command UX and spawn behavior stable.
acceptance:
  - Prompt rendering/building logic is extracted into dedicated module(s) and imported by
    wu-spawn.ts.
  - Strategy/client resolution logic is extracted without changing branch/lane behavior.
  - wu:spawn command output and execution semantics remain backward compatible.
