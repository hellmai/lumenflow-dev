description: 'Bug: orchestrate:initiative --dry-run ignores WU dependencies when building execution
  plan. WU-1240 has dependencies: [WU-1234] but both are placed in Wave 0. The wave calculation
  should respect the dependencies array and only place WUs in a wave after all their dependencies
  are scheduled in earlier waves. Discovered while validating INIT-008.'
acceptance:
  - WUs with dependencies are placed in waves AFTER their dependencies
  - orchestrate:initiative --dry-run shows correct wave structure
  - Unit test covers dependency ordering in wave calculation
