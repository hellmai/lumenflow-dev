description: The release script pushes a version bump commit to origin/main BEFORE running build,
  pack validation, and npm publish. If any of those steps fail, main is left with a ghost version
  bump for a version that was never released. Additionally, parsePackDryRunMetadata fails when pnpm
  lifecycle output pollutes stdout before JSON. Both issues hit during the 3.2.1 release attempt.
acceptance:
  - Version bump commit is only pushed to origin/main after build, validation, and publish all
    succeed
  - parsePackDryRunMetadata strips pnpm lifecycle output from stdout before JSON.parse
  - If any step fails, main remains untouched
  - Existing tests updated to reflect new ordering
