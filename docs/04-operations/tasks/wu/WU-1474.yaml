tests:
  manual:
    - Set memory.decay.enabled=true with trigger=on_done
    - complete a WU
    - and confirm stale memory entries are archived without blocking wu:done.
    - Run cleanup in preview mode and confirm decay behavior is reported without mutating active
      entries.

description: 'Context: decay/archival exists but is not consistently triggered from lifecycle flows.
  Problem: stale memory accumulates without policy-driven execution. Solution: add configurable
  memory.decay policy and invoke decay archival during completion lifecycle when configured, while
  preserving manual cleanup controls.'
acceptance:
  - Config schema supports memory.decay fields (enabled, threshold, half_life_days, trigger).
  - wu:done invokes decay archival when memory.decay.enabled=true and trigger=on_done, with
    fail-open behavior.
  - When decay is disabled, existing wu:done behavior is unchanged.
  - Manual cleanup command remains available and supports preview behavior.
