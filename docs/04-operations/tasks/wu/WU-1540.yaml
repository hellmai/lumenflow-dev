description: 'Context: ACTIVE_WU_STATUSES currently means different things across cleanup and
  initiative progression paths. Problem: shared naming hides distinct semantics and invites future
  logic drift. Solution: introduce explicit PROTECTED_WU_STATUSES and PROGRESSABLE_WU_STATUSES
  constants, migrate call sites, and add tests covering expected behavior.'
acceptance:
  - Cleanup and signal protection paths use PROTECTED_WU_STATUSES including blocked.
  - Initiative progression paths use PROGRESSABLE_WU_STATUSES excluding blocked.
  - Tests assert constant semantics and progression behavior for blocked and in_progress statuses.
