description: Decompose packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/hooks/enforcement-generator.ts into per-hook
  generator modules with a thin dispatcher/orchestrator entrypoint.
acceptance:
  - Individual hook script generators are moved into dedicated files under hooks/generators.
  - enforcement-generator.ts retains dispatcher behavior and public contract compatibility.
  - Generated hook script content remains unchanged for existing options.
