description: ~150 test files exist in ExampleApp tools/__tests__/ that were not migrated when LumenFlow was extracted to hellmai/os. This causes low coverage in core (42%) and cli (27%). Migrate tests to appropriate @lumenflow/* packages.
acceptance:
  - All relevant tests from ExampleApp tools/__tests__/ migrated to hellmai/os packages
  - Coverage in @lumenflow/core increases to at least 70%
  - Coverage in @lumenflow/cli increases to at least 50%
  - All migrated tests pass
