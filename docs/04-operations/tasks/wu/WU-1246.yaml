description: 'Context: Currently wu:create requires --id WU-XXXX to be specified manually. This
  leads to collisions when multiple agents work in parallel, requires checking existing IDs, and
  creates friction. Problem: Manual ID assignment is error-prone and unnecessary coordination
  overhead. Agents must check backlog for next available ID before creating WUs. Solution: Make --id
  optional. When omitted, wu:create should auto-generate the next available WU ID by scanning
  existing WU YAMLs, finding the highest numeric ID, and incrementing. Output the generated ID so
  the user knows what was created. Keep --id as optional override for specific cases (e.g.,
  reserving a block of IDs).'
acceptance:
  - wu:create works without --id flag
  - Auto-generated ID is next sequential after highest existing WU-NNNN
  - Generated ID printed clearly in output
  - --id flag still works as explicit override
  - Concurrent wu:create calls handle race conditions (retry on conflict)
  - Unit tests cover ID generation and conflict handling
  - Documentation updated
  - CLAUDE.md updated with new wu:create usage (--id now optional)
  - LUMENFLOW.md Quick Start section updated
  - Starlight docs CLI reference updated (lumenflow.dev)
  - npm package README updated
  - --help output shows --id as optional with auto-generation note
