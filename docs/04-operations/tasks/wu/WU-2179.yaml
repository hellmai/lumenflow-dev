description: "Context: Agent-facing docs (quick-ref-commands.md, CLAUDE.md) have fallen ~25 commands behind the actual CLI surface. Problem: Agents don't discover commands like lumenflow:upgrade, cloud:connect, pack:*, file:*/git:*, agent:session etc. More critically, no doc explains that tooling operations (upgrade, config:set, docs:sync) use micro-worktree and don't need WUs — causing agents to create unnecessary WUs or use raw pnpm commands. Solution: Sweep quick-ref-commands.md against lumenflow:commands output, add all missing commands, and add a Tooling Operations section explaining micro-worktree commands vs WU-required code changes."
acceptance:
  - All commands from lumenflow:commands are present in quick-ref-commands.md
  - New Tooling Operations section explains micro-worktree commands that don't need WUs
  - cloud:connect documented with flags from quickstart.mdx
  - lumenflow:upgrade documented with --version and --latest flags
  - CLAUDE.md and .claude/CLAUDE.md reference tooling operations section
  - docs:validate passes
