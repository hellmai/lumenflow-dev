description: When a tool execution is denied by policy or scope, the web UI shows which policy
  denied it (policy_id, reason), the scope intersection that failed (requested vs allowed vs
  enforced), and a visual diff of what the agent wanted vs what governance permitted. This is the
  governance you can see differentiator.
acceptance:
  - Denied tool executions show policy_id and reason
  - Scope intersection visualized (requested vs allowed vs enforced)
  - Visual diff of attempted vs permitted actions
