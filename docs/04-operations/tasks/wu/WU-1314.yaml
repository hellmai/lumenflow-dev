description: Fully document the new plan tooling so agents can discover and use it without friction.
  Update internal onboarding docs (quick-ref, LUMENFLOW workflow) and Starlight docs
  (reference/guides) to show plan:create/link/edit/promote, repo plan storage, and how
  WUs/initiatives should link plans. Remove all references to initiative:plan.
acceptance:
  - Internal onboarding docs include a Plans section with examples
  - Starlight docs include plan tooling reference and workflow guidance
  - All references to initiative:plan removed
