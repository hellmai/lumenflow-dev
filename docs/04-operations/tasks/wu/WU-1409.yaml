description: 'Context: Agents guess command syntax and edit YAML directly. Problem: Missed --help
  usage leads to wrong commands and unsafe edits. Solution: Document a universal rule: if unsure,
  run --help before any command and do not guess. Applies to all LumenFlow commands and binaries via
  pnpm exec.'
acceptance:
  - 'Quickstart includes rule: run --help if unsure before any command'
  - LUMENFLOW.md includes same rule in core workflow guidance
