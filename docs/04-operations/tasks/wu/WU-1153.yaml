description: wu:done can roll back metadata after commit if code_paths were not committed, risking lost work. Add a preflight guard that checks code_paths are committed before metadata writes.
acceptance:
  - wu:done aborts before metadata commit when code_paths are uncommitted
  - error message instructs user to commit code changes
  - unit test covers the guard
