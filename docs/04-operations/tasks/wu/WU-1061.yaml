description: Move docs regeneration from pre-commit hook to wu:done. After gates pass, detect if
  doc-source files changed using cheap git diff. If yes, run turbo docs:generate (cached), stage
  outputs, include in metadata commit. Zero overhead when no doc-source changes.
acceptance:
  - wu:done detects doc-source changes using git diff with pathspecs (tools/generate-cli-docs.ts,
    arg-parser.ts, lumenflow-config-schema.ts, index.ts, CLI src/, CLI package.json)
  - Detection uses defaultBranchFrom(docMain) with fallback to branch resolver (no hardcoded main)
  - wu:done runs turbo docs:generate when source changed (Turbo handles build deps + caching)
  - turbo.json has docs:generate task with dependsOn @lumenflow/core#build and precise inputs/outputs
  - Doc outputs staged before stageAndFormatMetadata(), included in single atomic commit
  - Pre-commit docs-sync hook removed (delete .husky/hooks/docs-sync.mjs AND remove its call from
    .husky/pre-commit)
  - Works in both worktree and branch-only modes
  - CI docs:validate remains as safety net
