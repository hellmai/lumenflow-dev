description: Wire the HTTP surface to push kernel events to the control plane via
  ControlPlaneSyncPort.pushKernelEvents. Enables centralized observability for organizations. Web
  dashboard can optionally pull from control plane instead of local EventStore.
acceptance:
  - HTTP surface pushes events to ControlPlaneSyncPort
  - pushKernelEvents called with correct event format
  - Dashboard can optionally read from control plane
