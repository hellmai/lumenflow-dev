description: The landing page hero tagline is too long — two strong sentences followed by a feature
  paragraph. Tighten to punchy hook + one-liner, swap CTA order so Get Started is primary, and add a
  terminal/code block below the hero showing LumenFlow in action (scope check or policy denial).
acceptance:
  - Hero tagline is two lines max — punchy hook + short descriptor
  - Get Started is the primary CTA, Why LumenFlow is secondary
  - Code/terminal block visible below hero showing LumenFlow governance in action
  - Astro build succeeds, Vercel deploy succeeds
