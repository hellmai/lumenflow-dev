  Post WU-2047: software-delivery is now runtime-native (zero CLI spawn bridges). No bundled/domain
  distinction needed — all packs are equal. This WU is purely about making resolvePacksRoot work
  outside the monorepo.


  Merged WU-2052 + WU-2053 into this WU. Post WU-2047: no bundled/domain distinction. Simple tier: 3
  code files + shallow deletions + docs.

description: 'Three changes in one: (1) Add CLI-relative candidate to resolvePacksRoot() so packs
  resolve when installed via npm. (2) Delete 5 stub packs (security-ops, compliance-audit,
  data-pipeline, infra-ops, legal-ops) that return TOOL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. (3) Document pack
  architecture and authoring guide.'
acceptance:
  - resolvePacksRoot falls back to CLI package location when workspace-relative packs dirs dont exist
  - CLI package.json includes packs/ in npm files array
  - 5 stub pack directories and community-packs.test.ts deleted
  - Build passes with no broken imports after stub deletion
  - Pack concepts and authoring guide added to docs
  - Docs build passes
