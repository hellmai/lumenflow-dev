description: Provide standalone recovery tool for bootstrap failures when CLI dist is broken. Prefer wu-stamp.mjs (Node built-ins only, no project build dependency) over raw bash. Tool creates stamp, appends schema-safe event to wu-events.jsonl, commits via micro-worktree pattern. Clear break-glass-only warnings. Idempotent and auditable.
acceptance:
  - scripts/wu-stamp.mjs runs without packages/*/dist
  - Creates valid .lumenflow/stamps/WU-XXX.done file
  - Appends valid completion event to wu-events.jsonl
  - Commits atomically via micro-worktree pattern
  - Idempotent on re-run (no duplicate stamps or events)
  - Prints break-glass warning on execution
