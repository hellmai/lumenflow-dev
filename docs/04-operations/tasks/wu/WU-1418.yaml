description: 'Context: wu:repair detects and fixes state inconsistencies (e.g., status.md out of sync with YAML). Problem: The repair commit gets blocked by the pre-push hook that prevents direct main pushes. Currently requires manual LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git push. Solution: wu:repair should internally handle pushing its own admin fix commits, either via LUMENFLOW_FORCE env var or a commit signature the hook recognizes.'
acceptance:
  - wu:repair successfully pushes its fix commits without manual intervention
  - Pre-push hook recognizes and allows wu:repair commits (via env var or commit signature)
  - Existing pre-push protections remain intact for non-repair pushes
