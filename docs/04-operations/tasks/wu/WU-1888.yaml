description: Umbrella coordination WU for split migration of maintenance/delegation command
  families. Delivery is completed by WU-1893 (state transitions), WU-1894 (delegation/context), and
  WU-1895 (cleanup/admin), after which this umbrella WU gates downstream migration phases.
acceptance:
  - Declared maintenance/delegation WU commands are implemented with real software-delivery pack
    handlers
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated maintenance/delegation commands
  - Runtime execution of migrated maintenance/delegation commands succeeds without CLI fallback
