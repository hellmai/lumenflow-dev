description: After core lifecycle commands are migrated, remaining WU maintenance and delegation surfaces must move to real software-delivery handlers to eliminate fallback-only behavior across work-unit execution. This WU migrates wu:block, wu:unblock, wu:edit, wu:release, wu:recover, wu:repair, wu:deps, wu:prune, wu:delete, wu:cleanup, wu:brief, wu:delegate, wu:unlock-lane, wu:proto, and wu:sandbox.
acceptance:
  - Declared maintenance/delegation WU commands are implemented with real software-delivery pack handlers
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated maintenance/delegation commands
  - Runtime execution of migrated maintenance/delegation commands succeeds without CLI fallback
