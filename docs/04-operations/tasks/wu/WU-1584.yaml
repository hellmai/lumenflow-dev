description: 'Context: core strict backlog remains concentrated in lifecycle-critical flows
  including spawn and wu:done orchestration helpers. Problem: these hotspots carry high operational
  risk and block later strict migration waves. Solution: remove strict debt in lifecycle hotspots
  first with explicit types, safe narrowing, and error normalization while preserving orchestration
  behavior.'
acceptance:
  - Strict errors are removed from targeted core lifecycle hotspot files
  - Lifecycle behavior and output contracts remain unchanged under existing tests
  - No net increase in as any usage in touched core files
  - Core lifecycle unit/integration tests pass
  - Core strict progress baseline reflects reduced debt for this wave
