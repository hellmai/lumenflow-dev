description: 'Context: signal creation is append-only but read-marking rewrites the full file. Problem: concurrent agents can overwrite read-state updates. Solution: add append-only signal receipts and merge semantics in load/read/cleanup paths while preserving backward compatibility for inline read flags.'
acceptance:
  - markSignalsAsRead appends receipts instead of rewriting signals.jsonl.
  - loadSignals derives effective read state from inline read:true and appended receipts.
  - signal cleanup remains correct and receipt-aware under mixed legacy/new data.
  - Concurrent read-marking tests demonstrate no lost updates.
