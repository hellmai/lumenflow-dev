title: Append-only signal read receipts for concurrent-safe consumption
lane: 'Framework: Memory'
type: feature
status: in_progress
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-06
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/memory/src/mem-signal-core.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/memory/src/signal-cleanup-core.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Verify markSignalsAsRead does not modify signals.jsonl
    - Verify loadSignals merges receipt-based read state with inline read:true
    - Verify cleanup removes orphaned receipts for cleaned-up signals
    - Verify concurrent markSignalsAsRead calls do not lose updates

description: 'Context: signal creation is append-only but read-marking rewrites the full file.
  Problem: concurrent agents can overwrite read-state updates. Solution: add append-only signal
  receipts and merge semantics in load/read/cleanup paths while preserving backward compatibility
  for inline read flags.'
acceptance:
  - markSignalsAsRead appends receipts instead of rewriting signals.jsonl.
  - loadSignals derives effective read state from inline read:true and appended receipts.
  - signal cleanup remains correct and receipt-aware under mixed legacy/new data.
  - Concurrent read-marking tests demonstrate no lost updates.
