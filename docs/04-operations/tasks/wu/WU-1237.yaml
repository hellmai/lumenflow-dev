description: 'Context: LumenFlow has mem:triage to promote discoveries into WUs. But there is no
  mechanism to promote session learnings into project-level knowledge that persists across WUs.
  Problem: Patterns discovered in WU-1200 are not available in WU-1500. Mistakes made once get
  repeated. Cross-WU knowledge transfer does not exist. Solution: Two complementary commands: (1)
  mem:promote - Turn WU/session learnings into project-level nodes. Input: nodeId or WU id. Output:
  new summary/note node with lifecycle=project. Provenance: relationship discovered_from or related
  back to source. Taxonomy tags (enforced): decision, convention, pattern, pitfall, interface,
  invariant, faq. (2) mem:profile - Render top N project knowledge for injection. Aggregates
  promoted items. Used by mem:context to build project profile section. Supports filtering by tag
  category. Output format matches mem:context expectations. Mirrors mem:triage pattern (existing
  code). Promotion is explicit (not automatic) to ensure quality.'
acceptance:
  - mem:promote --node mem-xxxx creates project-level node from source
  - mem:promote --wu WU-XXXX promotes all summaries from that WU
  - Promoted nodes have lifecycle=project and relationship to source
  - 'Tags enforced from taxonomy: decision|convention|pattern|pitfall|interface|invariant|faq'
  - mem:profile outputs top N project-level memories (default N=20)
  - mem:profile --tag decision filters by tag category
  - Profile output is formatted for mem:context integration
  - --dry-run shows what would be promoted without writing
  - Unit tests cover promotion logic and profile aggregation
  - Documentation updated in memory package README
