description: 'Context: lumenflow init scaffolds .gitignore with .lumenflow/state/ ignored. Problem:
  wu:claim must commit state events to .lumenflow/state/ - first claim fails with ignored by
  .gitignore. Solution: remove .lumenflow/state/ from scaffold .gitignore.'
acceptance:
  - .lumenflow/state/ is NOT in the scaffolded .gitignore
  - .lumenflow/telemetry/ remains ignored
  - wu:claim succeeds on first attempt in a fresh project with no gitignore conflict
