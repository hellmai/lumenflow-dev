risks:
  - 'lumenflow:upgrade workflow gap: updates package.json on main but pnpm install blocked by worktree discipline'
notes: |
  KNOWN ISSUE: lumenflow:upgrade modifies package.json on main via micro-worktree,
  but subsequent pnpm install is blocked by worktree hooks.

  SOLUTION: Use worktree pattern consistent with wu:* tooling:
  1. Create temp upgrade worktree (like wu:claim creates worktrees)
  2. Update package.json in worktree
  3. Run pnpm install in worktree (no hooks blocking - worktrees allow this)
  4. Commit package.json + pnpm-lock.yaml
  5. Merge to main via micro-worktree pattern (like wu:done)

  This maintains worktree discipline consistency across all tooling.

description: Migrate deps-add, deps-remove, session-coordinator, rotate-progress, lumenflow-upgrade, trace-gen from ExampleApp. These are the remaining generic tools. Some have existing tests.
acceptance:
  - deps-add.ts and deps-remove.ts exist with tests
  - session-coordinator.ts exists
  - rotate-progress.ts exists
  - lumenflow-upgrade.ts exists with tests
  - lumenflow-upgrade uses worktree pattern (install runs in worktree, not main)
  - trace-gen.ts exists
  - All bin entries added
  - '>80% coverage on migrated code'
