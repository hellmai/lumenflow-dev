description: 'Context: LumenFlow memory has storage and lifecycle but no way to inject relevant
  context at session start. Supermemory and similar tools automatically inject relevant memories
  when a new agent session begins. Problem: When wu:spawn creates a new agent session, it has no
  access to relevant project knowledge, recent summaries, or WU-specific context from the memory
  layer. Agents start cold without accumulated knowledge. Solution: Add mem:context command that
  produces a deterministic, formatted context injection block containing: (1) Project profile items
  (top N project-lifecycle memories), (2) Recent summaries relevant to the target WU/lane, (3)
  Current WU ready nodes and latest checkpoint, (4) Open discoveries for the WU. Output is
  structured text suitable for embedding into wu:spawn. Selection is deterministic (filter by
  lifecycle, WU, tags, recency). No LLM calls inside LumenFlow (vendor-agnostic).'
acceptance:
  - mem:context --wu WU-XXXX outputs formatted context block
  - 'Context block includes: project profile, relevant summaries, WU context'
  - 'Selection is deterministic: filter by lifecycle=project, wu_id match, recency'
  - Output format is structured markdown with clear sections
  - Max context size is configurable (default 4KB)
  - 'Graceful degradation: empty block if no memories match'
  - Output is suitable for embedding into wu:spawn prompts (integration tracked in WU-1240)
  - Unit tests cover selection logic and output formatting
  - Documentation updated in memory package README
