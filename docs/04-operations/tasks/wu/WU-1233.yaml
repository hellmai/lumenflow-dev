description: 'Context: When CLI commands are piped through head/tail, the process crashes with EPIPE
  error if async operations are in flight when the pipe closes. This caused WU-1218 agent to kill
  wu:done mid-transaction. Problem: Node.js throws unhandled EPIPE errors on stdout/stderr when
  downstream pipe closes, crashing long-running CLI commands. Solution: Add centralized EPIPE
  handler in CLI entry point with proper abstraction following SOLID principles.'
acceptance:
  - EPIPE errors on stdout/stderr are caught and exit gracefully
  - Handler uses constants from wu-constants.ts (no hardcoded strings)
  - 'Single responsibility: separate module for stream error handling'
  - Dependency injection pattern for testability
  - Unit tests cover EPIPE handling with mocked streams
  - Integration test confirms piped CLI commands exit cleanly
