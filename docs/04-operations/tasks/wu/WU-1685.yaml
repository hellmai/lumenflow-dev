description: 'Context: Validator Layer V2 is merged, but we still have adapter-level mapping spread
  across lint/preflight/CLI entrypoints. Problem: duplicated issue-shaping and warning projection
  increases drift risk and makes behavior harder to reason about. Solution: centralize validation
  result normalization and keep command-facing behavior stable while reducing duplicated mapping
  logic.'
acceptance:
  - Validation issue shaping is produced from one shared normalization path reused by lint and
    preflight adapters.
  - CLI consumers (create/edit/validate/prep/done) read normalized warning/error output without
    duplicate mapping blocks.
  - Regression tests confirm backward-compatible command output while reducing adapter duplication.
