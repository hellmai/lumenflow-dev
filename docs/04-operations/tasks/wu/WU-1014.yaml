  Add error logging to worktreeRemove fallback rmSync in git-adapter.ts.

  Context: The worktreeRemove function has a "Layer 1 defense" (WU-1476) that
  calls rmSync after git worktree remove succeeds, to handle edge cases where
  the directory is left behind.

  Problem: The rmSync call on line 528 is outside the try-catch block. If it
  throws (permission denied, file locked, etc.), the error propagates with no
  logging about what failed. This makes debugging difficult when wu:done or
  wu:cleanup fails silently.

  Solution: Wrap the fallback rmSync in try-catch with descriptive error
  logging that includes the worktree path and original error message.
acceptance:
  - Fallback rmSync wrapped in try-catch with console.warn logging
  - Log message includes worktree path and error message
  - Unit test covers rmSync throwing after successful git worktree remove
  - pnpm format, lint, typecheck → PASS
