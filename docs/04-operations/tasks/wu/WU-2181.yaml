description: 'WU-2180 fixed missing gitignore entries in lumenflow init scaffolding but shipped without documentation. Need: CHANGELOG entry under Unreleased, migration/remediation guidance for consumers who already have tracked ephemeral files, and document that lumenflow init --skip backfills missing entries.'
acceptance:
  - CHANGELOG.md Unreleased section has entry for gitignore scaffold fix
  - Migration/remediation steps documented for consumers with tracked ephemeral files
  - lumenflow init --skip backfill behavior documented
