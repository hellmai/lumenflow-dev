description: 'Context: @lumenflow/core consumer-integration tests fail on main because expected CLI
  binaries (notably validate-backlog-sync) are missing from installed @lumenflow/cli package.
  Problem: this blocks full gates and forces skip-gates usage in unrelated WUs. Solution: align CLI
  package bin exposure and consumer integration expectations, with regression tests proving required
  binaries resolve from npm install layout.'
acceptance:
  - Consumer integration binary-resolution suite passes
  - Required CLI binaries expected by consumer integration are present and executable after package
    install
  - Core package targeted test run for consumer integration passes without workaround flags
