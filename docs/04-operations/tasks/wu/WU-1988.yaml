description: WU-1987 fix was reverted by prettier formatting. Step 1 code block loses its indent
  because prettier strips it for short list items. Need to restructure so prettier preserves the
  nesting.
acceptance:
  - pnpm turbo run build --filter=@lumenflow/docs succeeds AND prettier --check passes
