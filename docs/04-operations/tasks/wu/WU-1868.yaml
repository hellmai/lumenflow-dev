description: readReceiptsForTask in kernel-runtime.ts:934-953 calls readTraces() (returns ALL traces) and manually filters by task_id. EvidenceStore already has readTracesByTaskId(taskId) with a pre-built Map index. This is O(n) over entire trace history for every inspection — avoidable when the indexed accessor exists.
acceptance:
  - readReceiptsForTask uses evidenceStore.readTracesByTaskId instead of readTraces + filter
  - inspectTask returns identical results (no behavioral change)
  - Test verifies correct receipts returned when multiple tasks exist
