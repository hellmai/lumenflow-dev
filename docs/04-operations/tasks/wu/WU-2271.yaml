description: The redirect detection regex in block-bash-file-commands.sh falsely matches > inside
  email angle brackets (e.g. Co-Authored-By trailers), blocking legitimate git commits. Remove the
  regex entirely since named command blocks already cover redirect-based file writes.
acceptance:
  - Hook no longer blocks git commits containing Co-Authored-By trailers
  - Named command blocks (echo, cat) still catch redirect-based file writes
