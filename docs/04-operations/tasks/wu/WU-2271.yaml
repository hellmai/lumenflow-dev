notes: >-
  Removed the redirect regex pattern from block-bash-file-commands.sh that was falsely matching
  angle brackets in email addresses (e.g. Co-Authored-By trailers in git commit messages). The named
  command blocks for echo and cat already cover redirect-based file writes, making the generic
  redirect regex redundant and harmful.


  tdd-exception: Shell hook script has no automated test harness; fix verified by manual git commit
  with Co-Authored-By trailer. Removed the redirect regex pattern from block-bash-file-commands.sh
  that was falsely matching angle brackets in email addresses (e.g. Co-Authored-By trailers in git
  commit messages). The named command blocks for echo and cat already cover redirect-based file
  writes, making the generic redirect regex redundant and harmful.

description: The redirect detection regex in block-bash-file-commands.sh falsely matches > inside
  email angle brackets (e.g. Co-Authored-By trailers), blocking legitimate git commits. Remove the
  regex entirely since named command blocks already cover redirect-based file writes.
acceptance:
  - Hook no longer blocks git commits containing Co-Authored-By trailers
  - Named command blocks (echo, cat) still catch redirect-based file writes
