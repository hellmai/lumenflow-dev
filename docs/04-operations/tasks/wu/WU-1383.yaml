title: Add CLI safeguards against manual file editing
lane: 'Framework: CLI'
type: feature
status: done
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-03
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/init.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Run `pnpm exec lumenflow init --client claude` and verify enforcement hooks are enabled by
      default.
    - Re-run init when `.lumenflow.config.yaml` exists and confirm a warning is printed advising CLI
      usage instead of manual edits.
    - Verify post-init output lists core CLI commands and includes a manual-edit warning.

description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 testing showed agent wrote config files manually and worked on
  main without claiming WUs. Problem: No CLI-level warnings or enforcement to prevent common
  mistakes. Solution: (1) Enable enforcement hooks by default for --client claude, (2) Init should
  warn if config files already exist, (3) Improve post-init output to emphasize CLI usage.'
acceptance:
  - Init with --client claude enables enforcement hooks by default
  - Init warns if lumenflow config yaml already exists
  - Post-init output shows available commands prominently
  - Warning message suggests CLI commands not manual editing
