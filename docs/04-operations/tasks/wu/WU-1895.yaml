  rationale: decomposes WU-1888 into command-family atomic units to reduce context risk.'

description: Split from WU-1888. Migrate cleanup/admin commands (wu:prune, wu:delete, wu:cleanup,
  wu:unlock-lane, wu:sandbox) from fallback/stub execution to native software-delivery pack handlers
  with resolver wiring and parity coverage.
acceptance:
  - wu:prune, wu:delete, wu:cleanup, wu:unlock-lane, and wu:sandbox execute through
    software-delivery handlers in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for these cleanup/admin commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration mode
