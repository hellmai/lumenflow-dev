description: 'Context: LumenFlow framework docs are duplicated in docs/lumenflow and
  docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow, and agent onboarding lives separately in ai/onboarding.
  Problem: duplicate sources cause stale references and confusion about canonical docs, and
  Starlight docs may point to old paths. Solution: make the operations path canonical by removing
  docs/lumenflow, moving agent onboarding to
  docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding, and updating all doc references
  including the Starlight site.'
acceptance:
  - Remove docs/lumenflow directory after migrating any unique content.
  - Move ai/onboarding contents into docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding and
    remove the top-level ai/onboarding directory.
  - docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/wu-sizing-guide.md matches the tool-call/context-budget
    version (no hours).
  - README.md, LUMENFLOW.md, CLAUDE.md, and operations playbook references use the canonical
    operations paths.
  - Starlight content has no references to docs/lumenflow or ai/onboarding paths and links to the
    canonical playbook/agent onboarding.
  - No remaining doc references to docs/lumenflow (rg check).
  - pnpm gates --docs-only -> PASS
  - pnpm -C apps/docs build -> PASS
