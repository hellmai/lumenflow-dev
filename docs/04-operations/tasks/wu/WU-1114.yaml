description: 'Context: When agents compact/summarize context, they lose critical rules and start making mistakes. Problem: Current approach attempts complex recovery (hooks, agent frontmatter) which is vendor-specific and high effort. Solution: Prevention over recovery - enforce existing sizing guide thresholds as mandatory limits and document spawn-fresh as the standard pattern.'
acceptance:
  - wu-sizing-guide.md updated with mandatory thresholds (not guidelines)
  - wu-sizing-guide.md includes spawn-fresh policy section
  - constraints.md has brief note about context limits
  - LUMENFLOW.md has one-line reminder about spawn-fresh at top
  - context-management skill updated with spawn-fresh as primary strategy
