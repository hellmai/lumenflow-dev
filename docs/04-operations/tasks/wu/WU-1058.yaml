description: Comprehensive documentation audit found 30+ undocumented CLI commands, wrong config version/paths in quickstart, inconsistent lane format, phantom commands, and missing package documentation. This WU fixes all critical issues to ensure lumenflow.dev accurately represents the npm packages.
acceptance:
  - quickstart.mdx uses version 2.0 and correct directory paths
  - 'All examples use Parent: Sublane format for lanes'
  - Phantom commands (gates:format/lint/typecheck/test) removed from cli.mdx
  - All 46 CLI commands documented with correct flags
  - Config defaults in docs match actual schema defaults
  - lanes.enforcement section documented in config.mdx
  - Metrics guide created documenting DORA metrics and flow analysis
  - Initiatives guide created documenting multi-phase projects
  - Memory concept updated with triage and summarize commands
  - Docs build successfully and deployed to lumenflow.dev
