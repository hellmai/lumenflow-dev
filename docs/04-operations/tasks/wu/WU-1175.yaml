description: GitHub Actions CI and Vercel deployments trigger on every push to main, including WU metadata changes (specs, stamps, state) and documentation. This wastes resources and fails when GitHub credits are exhausted.
acceptance:
  - GitHub CI workflow has paths-ignore for .lumenflow/**, docs/04-operations/tasks/**, and *.md files
  - Vercel lumenflow-app project has commandForIgnoringBuildStep to skip non-app changes
  - Vercel lumenflow-docs project has commandForIgnoringBuildStep to skip non-docs changes
  - WU creation/completion no longer triggers CI or Vercel builds
