description: When wu:prep fails on spec:linter due to pre-existing WU validation errors (not caused by the current WU), print a ready-to-copy wu:done --skip-gates command with reason and fix-wu. This prevents agents from getting stuck asking for guidance when the skip-gates path is explicitly allowed by LumenFlow constraints.
acceptance:
  - When spec:linter fails, wu:prep checks if failures exist on main
  - If failures are pre-existing, prints copy-paste wu:done --skip-gates command
  - Command includes --reason and --fix-wu placeholders
