      graph tests

description: wu:done full gate runs intermittently fail in
  packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/wu-done.test.ts with @xstate/graph toDirectedGraph undefined
  values errors, even when isolated test runs pass. Stabilize test setup or guard graph traversal to
  eliminate nondeterministic failures.
acceptance:
  - wu-done model-based graph tests are deterministic under changed-test gate execution
  - wu:done no longer fails on @xstate/graph undefined-values errors for unchanged WUs
  - tests/documentation capture the stabilized behavior
