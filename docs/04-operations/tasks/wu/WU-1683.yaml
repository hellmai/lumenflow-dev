description: "Context: Plans (Claude Code .claude/plans/, LumenFlow docs/04-operations/plans/) are created for WUs but have no formal link back to the WU YAML. Problem: spec_refs is a generic bag of links — it doesn't distinguish 'this is THE plan' from 'a reference doc'. Sub-agents spawned via wu:brief never see the plan. Solution: Add a first-class 'plan' field to the WU schema that links to the plan file, similar to how initiatives have plan files."
acceptance:
  - WU schema supports an optional 'plan' field (path to plan file)
  - wu:create/wu:claim auto-populates plan field when a plan file is detected
  - wu:status surfaces the linked plan file path
  - Spec completeness validator checks plan file exists when field is set
