description: Integrate state:cleanup into wu:done to automatically clean up signals, memory, and
  events after successful WU completion. Friction-free workflow - users never need to remember to
  run cleanup.
acceptance:
  - State cleanup runs automatically after wu:done success
  - Cleanup is non-fatal - failures warn but don't fail wu:done
  - Add cleanup.trigger config option (on_done | on_init | manual) with 'on_done' default
  - Cleanup output is summarized in single line (not verbose)
