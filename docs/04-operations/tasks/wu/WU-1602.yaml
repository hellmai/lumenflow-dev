description: Current docs and onboarding copy often imply that wu:spawn executes a sub-agent, while the command actually generates handoff content. This WU aligns terminology to delegation intent and clarifies that prompt generation and execution are separate concerns.
acceptance:
  - Framework and onboarding docs describe wu:spawn/briefing behavior as prompt generation rather than automatic execution.
  - Delegation provenance language is updated to distinguish intent recording from pickup/execution confirmation.
  - Command references remain accurate and internally consistent across AGENTS.md, LUMENFLOW.md, and onboarding docs.
