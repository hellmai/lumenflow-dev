tests:
  manual:
    - Run wu:create --validate for a non-doc WU with empty tests.manual and verify behavior matches wu:claim policy

description: 'Context: wu:create --validate allows non-documentation WUs with tests.manual empty when other test buckets are populated. Problem: wu:claim then hard-fails the same WU because tests.manual is mandatory at claim time. Solution: align create-time validation and/or claim requirement so a WU that passes wu:create --validate is claimable without surprise.'
acceptance:
  - A non-doc WU with tests.manual empty fails consistently at create-time (or claim rule is relaxed) per single documented policy
  - Validation behavior is consistent across wu:create --validate and wu:claim
  - Regression tests cover the mismatched scenario (manual empty + unit tests present)
