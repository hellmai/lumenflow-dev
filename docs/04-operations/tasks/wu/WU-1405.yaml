description: 'Context: Agents are asking to scaffold frameworks during LumenFlow setup. Problem:
  Setup must be LumenFlow-only; stack scaffolding should be a separate WU. Solution: Add explicit
  prompt constraints and decision ladder guidance to defer scaffolding into a WU.'
acceptance:
  - Prompt forbids scaffolding/templates during setup
  - Prompt instructs to create a WU when user asks for stack/scaffold
  - Decision ladder includes stack-setup WU guidance
