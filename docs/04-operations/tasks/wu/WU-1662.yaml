description: 'Context: wu:done orchestration and recovery logic currently operate as an implicit
  state machine spread across large modules with overlapping rollback paths. Problem: state
  transitions, recovery boundaries, and snapshot semantics are difficult to reason about and test
  exhaustively. Solution: introduce a typed XState v5 machine definition in core for wu:done
  pipeline states and transition contracts, with snapshot/rehydration support designed as the
  canonical execution model.'
acceptance:
  - A typed wu:done pipeline state machine definition exists in core with explicit
    states/events/guards for validate->prepare->gate->commit->merge->push->cleanup (and failure
    paths).
  - Machine snapshot serialization and rehydration behavior is validated with targeted unit coverage.
  - No public wu:done CLI behavior changes are introduced in this WU; this is machine-definition
    foundation work only.
  - State/recovery test coverage is expanded to assert valid/invalid transition contracts.
