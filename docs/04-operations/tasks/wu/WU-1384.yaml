title: Relax spec completeness checks for done/cancelled WUs

status: done

tests:
  manual:
    - Run `pnpm wu:validate --all` and confirm done/cancelled WUs with missing notes/tests/spec_refs
      no longer fail.
    - Create a ready WU missing notes/tests/spec_refs and confirm `pnpm wu:validate --id WU-XXXX`
      still fails in strict mode.

notes: Re-scoped to address legacy done WUs blocking spec:linter. Enforce completeness for active
  WUs only (ready/in_progress/blocked).

description: 'Context: spec:linter currently fails on main because legacy done/cancelled WUs are
  missing notes/tests/spec_refs. Problem: done WUs are immutable, so strict completeness should
  focus on active work. Solution: update completeness validation to skip done/cancelled WUs while
  keeping strict checks for ready/in_progress/blocked.'
acceptance:
  - wu:validate ignores completeness warnings for WUs with status done or cancelled.
  - Completeness warnings still fail validation for ready/in_progress/blocked WUs in strict mode.
  - Unit test updated to cover done/cancelled status behavior.
