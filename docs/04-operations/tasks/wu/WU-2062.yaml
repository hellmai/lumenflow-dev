description: 'Two remaining release script issues from WU-2061: (1) findJsonStartIndex matches
  bracket in log prefixes like [sync:bundled-packs] — needs to find [{ or { instead of bare [. (2)
  Build/validate phase materializes dist symlinks and triggers prepack scripts that generate packs/
  files. On failure these artifacts are left on main. Script must restore symlinks and clean
  generated files on any failure.'
acceptance:
  - parsePackDryRunMetadata correctly parses output with pnpm lifecycle prefixes like
    [sync:bundled-packs]
  - On any release failure, dist symlinks are restored and generated packs/ files are removed
  - Main working tree is always clean after release script exits, whether success or failure
