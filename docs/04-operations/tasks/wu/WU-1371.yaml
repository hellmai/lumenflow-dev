description: 'Extend tools/generate-cli-docs.ts to also generate packages/@lumenflow/cli/README.md from the same source data used for Starlight cli.mdx. This eliminates manual maintenance drift between README.md and cli.mdx (discovered in WU-1369 analysis: 10 commands missing from README but present in Starlight).'
acceptance:
  - generateReadmeMd() function added to tools/generate-cli-docs.ts
  - README.md generated with same command tables as current manual version
  - pnpm docs:generate updates both cli.mdx and README.md
  - pnpm docs:validate checks README.md for drift
  - Pre-release check passes (validates README.md has all bin entries)
  - WU-1369 can be closed as superseded
