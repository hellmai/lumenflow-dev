description: 'Context: file_read, file_write, file_edit, file_delete MCP tools shell out via
  runCliCommand. Problem: these 4 call sites contribute to the shell-out baseline. Solution:
  register in-process handlers using node:fs operations and route through executeViaPack helper.'
acceptance:
  - file_read, file_write, file_edit, file_delete route through runtime.executeTool()
  - runCliCommand is NOT called for any of these 4 tools
  - Output parity with legacy CLI path verified
