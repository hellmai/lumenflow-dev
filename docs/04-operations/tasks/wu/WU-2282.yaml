description: Fix wu:done checkpoint helper calls so mark/clear operations use worktree baseDir,
  preventing checkpoint files from being created or deleted in main checkout.
acceptance:
  - wu:done passes baseDir when calling markGatesPassed and clearCheckpoint
  - Add or update tests to cover scoped checkpoint behavior
  - No checkpoint artifact appears on main from this path
