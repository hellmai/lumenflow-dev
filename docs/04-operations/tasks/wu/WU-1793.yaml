description: 'Context: INIT-030 Phase 2 migrated task/runtime operations to KernelRuntime in
  MCP/CLI, and production MCP now serves registeredTools (legacy + runtime). Problem: parity and
  closure logic still compares against the legacy allTools baseline, which misstates migration
  progress and keeps migrated runtime commands in expected-missing sets. Solution: update parity
  closure logic to evaluate migration metrics against the production registry view while preserving
  explicit allowances for intentional MCP-only tools.'
acceptance:
  - MCP parity report used for closure can evaluate against production registered tool set (or an
    equivalent normalized runtime-inclusive view).
  - Expected-missing parity fixtures are updated so migrated runtime commands (task_claim,
    task_create, task_complete, task_block, task_unblock, task_inspect, tool_execute) are no longer
    treated as missing.
  - Unit/integration parity tests pass with no regressions to existing allowed-extra behavior.
