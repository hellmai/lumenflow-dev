description: 'Context: after lifecycle hotspots, strict debt remains in core WU management logic
  including repair, status transitions, and validation paths. Problem: these modules form central
  state and policy boundaries; weak typing here increases regression risk. Solution: remediate
  strict errors in management modules with explicit contracts and reusable narrowing patterns from
  Wave 0 foundations.'
acceptance:
  - Strict errors are removed from targeted WU management files
  - Validator and status-transition behavior remains stable under existing tests
  - No net increase in as any usage in touched core files
  - Core management and validator tests pass
  - Core strict progress baseline reflects reduced debt for this wave
