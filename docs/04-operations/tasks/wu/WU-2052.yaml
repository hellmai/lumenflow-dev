title: Fix filterExistingFiles CWD bug in incremental format check
lane: 'Framework: CLI WU Commands'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P2
created: 2026-02-22
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/gates-utils.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/gates-runners.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Run incremental format gate from main against a worktree WU that deletes a tracked file;
      verify deleted path is skipped and no missing-file prettier error appears.
    - Invoke filterExistingFiles with a cwd pointing at a temp directory and relative file list;
      verify only files that exist under that cwd are returned.

description: filterExistingFiles in gates-utils.ts uses access() with relative paths against
  process.cwd() instead of effectiveCwd, causing false positives when deleted files exist in main
  but not in the worktree
acceptance:
  - filterExistingFiles accepts an optional cwd parameter and checks paths relative to it
  - Deleted files are correctly filtered when wu:done gates run from main checkout
