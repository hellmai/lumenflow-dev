description: 'When code is already on main but WU metadata is incomplete (bootstrap failure, manual
  merge, aborted wu:done), wu:done requires a worktree that may not exist. Add --already-merged flag
  to skip merge phase and write stamp/events/backlog via micro-worktree. Safety check: verify
  code_paths exist on HEAD. Reuse existing metadata transaction from wu-done-metadata.ts.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done --already-merged --id WU-XXX skips merge phase entirely
  - Safety check verifies code_paths from YAML exist on HEAD of main
  - Stamp, completion event, backlog, and status are written via micro-worktree commit
  - Re-running is idempotent (stamp already_exists is not an error)
  - Fails with clear error if code_paths are NOT on main
