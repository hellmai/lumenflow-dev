description: "Two issues: (1) WU-1230 added state-doctor-fix.ts but didn't rebuild CLI dist, so
  import failed silently and fell back to direct writes. (2) state:doctor's withMicroWorktree call
  doesn't have retry logic for push failures when parallel agents are active. Fix: ensure CLI is
  rebuilt after code changes, and add retry logic to state-doctor-fix.ts push operations."
acceptance:
  - state:doctor --fix uses micro-worktree and commits/pushes changes (no uncommitted files on main
    after running)
  - Fix the spread override issue or diagnoseState calling wrong deps
