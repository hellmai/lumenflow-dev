description: 'WU-1230 added state-doctor-fix.ts with micro-worktree isolation, but state:doctor --fix still writes directly to local main. Evidence: running state:doctor --fix leaves uncommitted changes on main instead of pushing via micro-worktree merge.'
acceptance:
  - state:doctor --fix uses micro-worktree and commits/pushes changes (no uncommitted files on main after running)
  - Fix the spread override issue or diagnoseState calling wrong deps
