description: 'Context: After WU-1496 completed, related CLI/MCP parity and regenerated documentation
  changes remained unstaged on main. Problem: valuable changes are untracked and at risk. Solution:
  capture and complete these exact leftover changes in a dedicated cleanup WU.'
acceptance:
  - CLI public manifest and package metadata include mem:recover parity updates
  - MCP tools/runner and related tests reflect mem:recover support and CLI invocation fixes
  - Generated docs and CLI README are committed consistently with source changes
