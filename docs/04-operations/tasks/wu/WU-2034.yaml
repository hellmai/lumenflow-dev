description: 'Context: WU-2022 closed lane reader migration, but source still contains legacy .lumenflow.config.yaml references in runtime surfaces and generated guidance. Problem: kernel-first contract remains inconsistent and fails hard-cut expectations. Solution: remove remaining runtime/source dependencies on .lumenflow.config.yaml, migrate messaging/templates to workspace.yaml contract, and update tests to match.'
acceptance:
  - No runtime source file in scoped packages reads or requires .lumenflow.config.yaml
  - User-facing guidance in touched CLI templates references workspace.yaml/software_delivery, not legacy config
  - Targeted regression tests for migrated modules pass
