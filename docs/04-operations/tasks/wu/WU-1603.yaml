description: Separate naming from side effects by introducing wu:brief as the pure prompt-generation
  command. Keep wu:spawn as a backward-compatible alias with deprecation messaging so existing
  workflows continue to function while semantics are clarified.
acceptance:
  - wu:brief generates the same handoff payloads currently produced by wu:spawn for supported
    clients.
  - wu:spawn remains functional as a compatibility alias and emits clear deprecation guidance.
  - CLI help/docs for both commands describe prompt generation semantics accurately and consistently.
