description: 653 stale .mjs references remain in JSDoc comments pointing to old tools/lib/*.mjs paths. These are from before the TypeScript migration and should be removed or updated to point to current .ts locations.
acceptance:
  - No .mjs references in packages/@lumenflow/**/*.ts except cli-entry.mjs
  - All @see JSDoc comments point to valid current paths
