description: >-
  653 stale .mjs references remain in JSDoc comments pointing to old tools/lib/*.mjs paths. These
  are from before the TypeScript migration and should be removed or updated to point to current .ts
  locations.


  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. Find all .mjs refs: grep -rn '\.mjs' packages/@lumenflow --include='*.ts' | grep -v
  node_modules | grep -v __tests__

  2. For @see JSDoc comments: Either remove the @see line or update to point to current .ts file

  3. For string literals (like in wu-spawn prompts): Update to .ts or remove

  4. Exception: cli-entry.mjs is allowed to remain

  5. Verify: grep -rn '\.mjs' packages/@lumenflow --include='*.ts' | grep -v cli-entry | grep -v
  __tests__ should return 0 results
acceptance:
  - No .mjs references in packages/@lumenflow/**/*.ts except cli-entry.mjs
  - All @see JSDoc comments point to valid current paths
