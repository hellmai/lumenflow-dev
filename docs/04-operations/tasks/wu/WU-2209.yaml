description: 'Even with remote-aware ID gen (WU-2208), TOCTOU race exists: two machines fetch
  simultaneously, both see same highest ID, both generate same next ID. Fix: on push failure
  (non-fast-forward / detected duplicate), retry with fetch-regenerate-rewrite-push. Bounded retries
  (3). Extends existing generateWuIdWithRetry() which only handles local filesystem races.'
acceptance:
  - On push conflict due to duplicate ID, wu:create retries with fresh ID automatically
  - Retry fetches latest main, regenerates ID, rewrites YAML, re-commits, re-pushes
  - Maximum 3 retries with exponential backoff
  - Failure after max retries produces actionable error message
  - Two concurrent wu:create runs on different machines produce distinct IDs
