description: Agent session memory.jsonl writes can dirty worktrees during gates or wu:done. Add a repo-level ignore or configurable output path to keep worktrees clean.
acceptance:
  - running gates/wu:done does not modify tracked memory.jsonl files
  - worktree remains clean after agent memory writes
  - manual verification covers the new behavior
