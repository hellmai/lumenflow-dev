description: "Context: wu:done expects an active worktree to exist for the WU being completed.
  Problem: When a worktree is manually merged to main and then deleted (or nuked by git), wu:done
  cannot complete — leaving the WU in an orphaned state: no completion stamp, backlog not updated,
  WU YAML stuck at 'ready' status, wu-events.jsonl shows 'release' instead of 'done'. In Haven test
  project, WU-1 was manually merged and worktree deleted, resulting in permanent orphaned state that
  wu:recover also could not fix. Solution: wu:done should detect the 'branch already merged to main,
  worktree gone' scenario and still stamp/cleanup gracefully. Check if the WU's commits are
  reachable from HEAD, and if so, proceed with stamping and state updates even without a live
  worktree."
acceptance:
  - wu:done detects when WU branch commits are already merged to main
  - wu:done completes stamping and state cleanup even when worktree is gone
  - wu:recover can handle released-but-not-done WUs with merged commits
