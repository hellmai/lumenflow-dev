description: 'Context: wu-done-worktree and gates rely on process.chdir to switch execution context.
  Problem: global cwd mutation introduces hidden coupling and blocks safe parallelization. Solution:
  refactor affected flows to pass explicit cwd and path context through adapters and subprocess
  calls without mutating process-global state.'
acceptance:
  - wu-done-worktree and gates no longer rely on process.chdir for normal execution paths.
  - Git and file operations receive explicit cwd/baseDir parameters through helper layers.
  - Regression tests cover multi-path execution and confirm behavior without cwd mutation side
    effects.
