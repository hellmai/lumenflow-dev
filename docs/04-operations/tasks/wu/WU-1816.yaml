description: The EventStore currently only supports pull-based replay(filter) which re-reads the entire JSONL file. Add EventStore.subscribe(filter, callback) returning a Disposable that uses fs.watch() + seek-to-last-offset to parse only new lines. This is the reactive primitive that SSE streaming, AG-UI, and control plane forwarding all depend on.
acceptance:
  - EventStore.subscribe(filter, cb) returns Disposable
  - Callback fires within 500ms of new event being appended
  - Only new lines parsed (seek-to-offset, not full re-read)
  - Filter works for taskId, kind, and timestamp
  - Dispose stops delivery and cleans up watcher
