description: Agents must not delete worktrees that belong to other sessions. Only proper workflow
  (wu:done, wu:prune) should remove worktrees. Add hook or guard to prevent git worktree remove
  commands from agents.
acceptance:
  - git worktree remove blocked by hook for agents
  - wu:done and wu:prune can still remove worktrees
  - Error message explains proper workflow
