description: 'Break wu-spawn.ts (2342 lines, 20+ exports) into focused modules:
  spawn-template-assembler.ts (template loading/assembly), spawn-policy-resolver.ts (policy-based
  generation), spawn-guidance-generators.ts (test/architecture/design sections),
  spawn-constraints-generator.ts (constraint block generation), spawn-task-builder.ts (task
  invocation building). Partial decomposition already exists (wu-spawn-helpers.ts,
  wu-spawn-skills.ts, wu-spawn-context.ts) but the main file still holds the bulk.'
acceptance:
  - wu-spawn.ts reduced to under 500 lines (thin facade or re-export module)
  - Each extracted module has a single responsibility and under 500 lines
  - All existing wu-spawn tests pass without modification
  - Public API (index.ts exports) unchanged — zero breaking changes
