description: 'The web app currently uses LUMENFLOW_WEB_WORKSPACE_ROOT for two different concerns: workspace path safety boundary and kernel runtime workspace selection. When the boundary root is broad (for create/connect flows), runtime initialization can fall back to preview mode. Runtime initialization errors are also swallowed, which makes /api/health non-actionable. Separate runtime workspace env selection and expose initialization failure details in runtime health.'
acceptance:
  - Runtime workspace root resolves from LUMENFLOW_WEB_RUNTIME_WORKSPACE_ROOT first, then falls back to LUMENFLOW_WEB_WORKSPACE_ROOT and process.cwd()
  - When runtime is enabled but unavailable, /api/health includes initialization failure detail
  - Preview guidance references both runtime workspace and boundary workspace env vars
  - Unit tests cover env precedence and failure diagnostics
