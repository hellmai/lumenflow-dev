description: 'Context: LumenFlow has a sophisticated automatic documentation generation system that
  keeps Starlight docs in sync with code. Problem: This system is not documented for maintainers -
  only implementation plan docs exist. Solution: Create a dedicated docs-generation.md guide
  explaining the single-source-of-truth pattern, trigger files, wu:done integration, and manual
  commands.'
acceptance:
  - New docs-generation.md created in agent/onboarding or appropriate location
  - Explains single-source-of-truth pattern (imports from built packages)
  - Lists trigger files that cause regeneration
  - Documents wu:done auto-detection flow
  - Shows manual commands (pnpm docs:generate, docs:validate)
  - Linked from release-process.md or lumenflow-complete.md
