description: 'Context: Testing lumenflow init on a fresh Next.js project revealed 5 friction points.
  Problem: (1) init does not install lumenflow as devDep so all commands fail post-scaffold, (2) npx
  lumenflow init fails because init is not a subcommand, (3) pack install fails by default, (4)
  scaffolded templates are not prettier-formatted so gates fail immediately, (5) pnpm setup collides
  with built-in pnpm command.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow init on a fresh project results in working CLI commands without manual intervention
  - Scaffolded files pass prettier format check out of the box
  - npx lumenflow init works as invocation (init recognized as implicit)
  - Pack install failure does not block init for new external projects
