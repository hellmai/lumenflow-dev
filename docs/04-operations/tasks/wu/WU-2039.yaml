description: 'Context: kernel-first hard cut landed, but config readers still carry scattered literal keys/type checks/default values in active runtime surfaces. Problem: this increases drift risk and violates DRY/no-magic guidance. Solution: centralize remaining config literals and numeric defaults in shared constants/helpers for core config and gates readers, then verify with tests and gates.'
acceptance:
  - No direct workspace config key/file-name string literals remain in touched runtime files; use shared constants/helpers.
  - No magic numeric defaults remain in touched runtime files; replace with named constants sourced from schema/policy defaults where possible.
  - Core tests cover updated helper/constant behavior and pass.
  - Gates pass for touched packages before completion.
