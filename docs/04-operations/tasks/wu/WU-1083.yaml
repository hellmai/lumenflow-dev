  Context: Agents using LumenFlow in external projects (e.g., exampleapp.co.uk v1.3.6) make 8+ failed attempts at wu:create because the onboarding docs don't exist in their project.

  Problem: lumenflow init scaffolds LUMENFLOW.md which references onboarding docs at docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/, but doesn't create those files. Same for .claude/skills/. Agents are told to read docs that don't exist.

  Solution: Update lumenflow init to scaffold agent onboarding docs when --full flag is used or Claude vendor is detected. Add skills scaffolding for Claude vendor. Create new wu-create-checklist.md with pre-flight validation steps. Add lumenflow docs:sync command for existing projects to get updated docs.
acceptance:
  - lumenflow init --full creates docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/ files
  - lumenflow init with Claude vendor creates .claude/skills/ with wu-lifecycle, worktree-discipline, lumenflow-gates
  - New wu-create-checklist.md exists with required fields table, lane format rules, plan storage locations
  - lumenflow docs:sync command syncs agent docs to existing projects
  - LUMENFLOW.md template only references docs that get scaffolded
  - Agent can successfully run wu:create on first attempt with new docs
