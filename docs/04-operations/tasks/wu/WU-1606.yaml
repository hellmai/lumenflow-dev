notes: >-
  Final docs consolidation pass for INIT-024; must run after command/provenance implementation WUs
  complete.


  Execution note: WU-1602 and WU-1606 intentionally overlap on internal/Starlight docs. Execute
  WU-1606 against the post-WU-1602 merged state and treat WU-1606 as final docs consolidation for
  INIT-024.

description: After command and provenance changes land, update internal docs and Starlight
  references so the published and in-repo documentation matches actual CLI behavior, command names,
  and provenance semantics.
acceptance:
  - Internal docs (AGENTS.md, LUMENFLOW.md, onboarding guides) reflect final
    wu:brief/wu:spawn/wu:delegate behavior and provenance terminology.
  - Starlight CLI docs and package README are regenerated/synced for command-surface changes.
  - Documentation drift check passes (docs:validate) with no pending generated-doc diffs.
