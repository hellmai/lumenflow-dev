description: 'Context: quick-ref-commands.md documents ~20 commands but CLI has 50+ user-facing
  commands. Problem: Agents cannot discover available tooling, defaulting to raw git/file
  operations. Solution: Update quick-ref-commands.md to be comprehensive, auto-generated from --help
  output to stay in sync.'
acceptance:
  - All wired package.json CLI commands documented
  - Commands organized by category (wu:, mem:, initiative:, etc.)
  - Each command has one-line description
  - Document kept under 300 lines for token efficiency
