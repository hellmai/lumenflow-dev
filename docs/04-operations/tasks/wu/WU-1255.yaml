  ## Investigation Notes

  ### Observed Behavior
  - initiative:create attempts push to origin/main from micro-worktree
  - Pre-push hook (.husky/pre-push) blocks with: 'BLOCKED: Direct push to main'
  - Command retries 3 times, all fail
  - Local commits remain stranded (committed to main but not pushed)
  - Workaround: LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git push origin main

  ### Expected Behavior
  - Should behave identically to wu:create/wu:edit
  - wu:create successfully pushes from micro-worktree without hook blocking

  ### Investigation Areas
  1. Compare pre-push hook logic for wu:create vs initiative:create
  2. Check if env vars (LUMENFLOW_CLI, LUMENFLOW_FORCE) are being set correctly
  3. Look at .husky/pre-push allowlisting logic for micro-worktree operations
  4. Verify branch detection in hook (tmp/wu-create/* vs tmp/initiative-create/*)

description: "The initiative:create and initiative:edit commands use the micro-worktree pattern for
  isolated commits, but unlike wu:create/wu:edit, they fail when the pre-push hook blocks with
  'BLOCKED: Direct push to main'. The commands retry 3 times and then fail, leaving local commits
  stranded. This requires manual LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git push to complete. Initiative commands should
  work identically to wu:create/wu:edit which successfully use the same micro-worktree pattern."
acceptance:
  - initiative:create succeeds without pre-push hook blocking
  - initiative:edit succeeds without pre-push hook blocking
  - Both commands work identically to wu:create and wu:edit micro-worktree pattern
  - No manual LUMENFLOW_FORCE workaround required for normal operation
