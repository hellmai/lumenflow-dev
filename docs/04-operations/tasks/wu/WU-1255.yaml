description: "The initiative:create and initiative:edit commands use the micro-worktree pattern for isolated commits, but unlike wu:create/wu:edit, they fail when the pre-push hook blocks with 'BLOCKED: Direct push to main'. The commands retry 3 times and then fail, leaving local commits stranded. This requires manual LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git push to complete. Initiative commands should work identically to wu:create/wu:edit which successfully use the same micro-worktree pattern."
acceptance:
  - initiative:create succeeds without pre-push hook blocking
  - initiative:edit succeeds without pre-push hook blocking
  - Both commands work identically to wu:create and wu:edit micro-worktree pattern
  - No manual LUMENFLOW_FORCE workaround required for normal operation
