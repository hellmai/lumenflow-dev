description: 'Context: WU-1596 aligned cleanup branch protection with isAgentBranch but this
  introduced a fail-open path when registry patterns are unavailable. Problem: in degraded/offline
  conditions isAgentBranch falls back to narrow defaults and claude/codex branches may be treated as
  deletable. Solution: restore hardcoded fallback protection for primary cloud branch prefixes while
  retaining centralized isAgentBranch checks, and add deterministic tests that do not rely on
  network registry fetches.'
acceptance:
  - Cloud cleanup continues to protect claude/* and codex/* even when agent pattern registry is
    unavailable.
  - Cleanup still protects centrally detected agent branches via isAgentBranch.
  - Unit tests for isCloudManagedBranch are deterministic and do not require network access.
  - Relevant cli tests and wu:prep pass.
