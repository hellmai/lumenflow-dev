description: 'Context: Turbo lint/typecheck currently report success while seven packages have missing scripts and are scheduled as <NONEXISTENT>. Problem: CI gate health is overreported and regressions can merge undetected. Solution: add real lint/typecheck scripts to all missing packages and enforce a no-<NONEXISTENT> invariant in gate execution output.'
acceptance:
  - All in-scope packages define lint and typecheck scripts with executable commands
  - pnpm lint runs real package tasks without <NONEXISTENT>
  - pnpm typecheck runs real package tasks without <NONEXISTENT>
  - Gate output and documentation clearly distinguish stub checks from enforced checks
