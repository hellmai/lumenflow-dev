description: Migrate remaining MCP runtime path checks and tool resolution logic away from hardcoded docs/worktrees literals to centralized config/constants-driven resolution.

  - runtime-tool-resolver and worktree-enforcement contain no banned runtime path literals
  - path-literal-guard no longer needs these MCP files in INIT-036 pending allowlist
