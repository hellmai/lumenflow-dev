description: "Context: Codex ran 'git worktree remove --force' despite docs. Problem: AGENTS.md
  Forbidden Commands is incomplete and lacks safe alternatives. Solution: Expand list and add Safe
  Alternatives section. Benefits all agents."
acceptance:
  - AGENTS.md Forbidden Commands includes git worktree remove, git clean, git checkout ., git branch
    -D
  - AGENTS.md has new Safe Alternatives section with wu:recover, wu:release, wu:prune
  - 'LUMENFLOW.md reinforces that all worktree management must use wu: commands'
