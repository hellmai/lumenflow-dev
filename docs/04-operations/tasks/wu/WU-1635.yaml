notes: Added section 2.6 (Canonical Lifecycle Map) to lumenflow-complete.md with command-mode matrix
  covering all wu:* and memory/orchestration commands in both worktree and cloud/branch-PR modes.
  Added Appendix A (Failure-Mode Runbook) with concrete remediation for main-behind-origin,
  partial-claim state, spawn-provenance enforcement, wu:recover usage, and common compound failures.
  Added cross-links from quick-ref-commands.md and wu-sizing-guide.md to both new sections.

description: Create a single canonical operations-doc reference that explains how wu:create,
  wu:claim, wu:brief, wu:prep, wu:done, wu:recover, and orchestration/memory tools fit together,
  plus a runbook for recurrent failure modes seen in active usage.
acceptance:
  - Canonical command-mode matrix (worktree vs cloud/branch-pr) is documented with expected location
    and handoff points
  - Failure-mode runbook includes concrete remediation for main-behind-origin, partial-claim state,
    spawn-provenance enforcement, and wu:recover usage
  - Updated docs are internally cross-linked from quick-ref and complete framework guidance
