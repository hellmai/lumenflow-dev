description: 'Context: cloud workflow docs still emphasize worktree/cherry-pick patterns and miss
  branch-pr semantics. Problem: operator and agent guidance diverges from intended first-class cloud
  lifecycle. Solution: update AGENTS/playbook/onboarding/vendor/quick-ref/constraints documentation
  to reflect explicit cloud activation, branch-pr lifecycle, and post-merge cleanup guidance.'
acceptance:
  - Cloud guidance in AGENTS.md and playbook uses branch-pr as first-class path, not
    cherry-pick-centric fallback.
  - starting-prompt.md and vendor-support.md document explicit cloud activation and config-driven
    auto-detect behavior.
  - quick-ref-commands.md includes cloud lifecycle command flow and post-merge cleanup guidance.
  - .lumenflow/constraints.md includes valid branch-pr exception language for worktree discipline.
  - Documentation remains consistent with shipped command behavior and config keys.
  - starting-prompt.md and .lumenflow/constraints.md explicitly instruct agents to evaluate lane
    fitness during WU/initiative scoping and propose lane changes when boundaries no longer fit
    scope
