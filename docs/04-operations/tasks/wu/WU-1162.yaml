description: |-
  Create a pre-release validation script specific to hellmai/os that checks: 1) All bin entries documented in README, 2) files array includes templates/. This is internal tooling - NOT baked into public wu:done/gates.

  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Create tools/pre-release-checks.ts
  2. Check: Extract bin entries from packages/@lumenflow/cli/package.json, verify each exists in README.md
  3. Check: Verify files array includes templates if templates/ dir exists
  4. Add script to package.json: pre-release:check
  5. Update release-process.md to require this check before release
acceptance:
  - Pre-release check script created in tools/
  - Script fails if bin entry missing from README
  - Script fails if templates dir exists but not in files array
  - release-process.md updated to require pre-release check
