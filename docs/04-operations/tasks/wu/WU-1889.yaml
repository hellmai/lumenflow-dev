description: Umbrella coordination WU for split migration of
  memory/initiative/plan/setup/orchestration command families. Delivery is completed by WU-1896
  (memory) and WU-1897 (initiative/plan/setup/orchestration), after which this umbrella WU gates
  downstream migration phases.
acceptance:
  - Memory, initiative, plan, setup, and orchestration command surfaces are backed by
    software-delivery handlers
  - Fallback-only resolver stubs are removed for migrated command families
  - Runtime execution for migrated command families succeeds without CLI fallback in bootstrapped
    mode
