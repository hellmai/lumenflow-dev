description: 'Pack #1 completion requires non-WU command families to execute through native software-delivery handlers instead of runtime fallback placeholders. This WU migrates memory, initiative, plan, setup, and orchestration command surfaces and updates resolver/manifest wiring so runtime-native behavior is consistent across the operational command set.'
acceptance:
  - Memory, initiative, plan, setup, and orchestration command surfaces are backed by software-delivery handlers
  - Fallback-only resolver stubs are removed for migrated command families
  - Runtime execution for migrated command families succeeds without CLI fallback in bootstrapped mode
