description: 'Context: lifecycle command registry now includes wu:brief. Problem:
  wu-lifecycle-schemas test still asserts 16 commands and fails global core tests/gates on main.
  Solution: align lifecycle schema/test expectations to current command set and preserve schema
  parity checks.'
acceptance:
  - Core lifecycle schema tests pass with current registry command count.
  - Registry parity assertions remain accurate for lifecycle command schemas.
  - Unrelated WUs can run gates without failing on stale lifecycle command count assertions.
