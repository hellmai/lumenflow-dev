description: 'BREAKING BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Currently wu:done must run from main checkout, causing
  docs:generate to write files to main filesystem even when worktree exists. This violates worktree
  discipline. Fix by allowing wu:done to run from worktree, generating docs there, then switching to
  main only for merge/cleanup.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done can be invoked from worktree directory
  - docs:generate writes to worktree filesystem, not main
  - Auto-detects location (main vs worktree) and adjusts behavior
  - Final merge/cleanup still happens from main (internally handled)
  - 'command-registry.ts: wu:done requiredLocation changed to null'
  - 'Agent onboarding docs updated: docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/'
  - LUMENFLOW.md quick-start updated to show new workflow
  - Migration notes for existing users documented
  - New wu:prep command runs gates + docs in worktree
  - wu:prep prints copy-paste 'cd main && wu:done --id' instruction
  - wu:done from main only does merge + cleanup (no gates/docs)
  - wu:done from worktree errors with 'use wu:prep instead' message
