description: 'BREAKING BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Currently wu:done must run from main checkout, causing docs:generate to write files to main filesystem even when worktree exists. This violates worktree discipline. Fix by allowing wu:done to run from worktree, generating docs there, then switching to main only for merge/cleanup.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done can be invoked from worktree directory
  - docs:generate writes to worktree filesystem, not main
  - Auto-detects location (main vs worktree) and adjusts behavior
  - Final merge/cleanup still happens from main (internally handled)
  - 'command-registry.ts: wu:done requiredLocation changed to null'
  - 'Agent onboarding docs updated: docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/'
  - LUMENFLOW.md quick-start updated to show new workflow
  - Migration notes for existing users documented
