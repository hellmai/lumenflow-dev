description: 'Context: Agents ask users to choose a project template during LumenFlow setup.
  Problem: Even asking about scaffolding violates setup-only scope. Solution: Add explicit
  constraint to not ask about templates/frameworks during setup and to defer stack discussions to a
  WU.'
acceptance:
  - Prompt forbids asking users to choose templates/frameworks during setup
  - Prompt says stack discussion becomes a WU after setup
