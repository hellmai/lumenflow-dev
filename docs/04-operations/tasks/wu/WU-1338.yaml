description: The consumer-integration test 'should have all required CLI binaries properly resolved'
  fails because the gates binary contains 'packages/@lumenflow/' path. This is a regression that
  needs investigation - the published npm package may have monorepo-specific paths embedded.
acceptance:
  - consumer-integration test passes
