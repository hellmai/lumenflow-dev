description: Existing Starlight pages describe pre-kernel LumenFlow. visual-overview has no kernel
  dispatch diagrams. gates.mdx describes raw shell commands not pack policies. ai-agents.mdx safety
  section is git-hooks-only, missing kernel enforcement and bwrap. quickstart.mdx has no mention of
  kernel or packs. work-units.mdx evidence section describes stamps not EvidenceStore. lanes.mdx
  missing scope boundary concept. Update all to reference new concept pages from WU-1911.
acceptance:
  - visual-overview.mdx includes kernel dispatch architecture diagram
  - gates.mdx explains gates as pack policies evaluated by PolicyEngine, not just shell commands
  - ai-agents.mdx safety section covers kernel enforcement, scope intersection, bwrap isolation
  - quickstart.mdx mentions kernel and pack architecture in context
  - work-units.mdx evidence section references EvidenceStore and evidence receipts
  - lanes.mdx explains lane scopes and their role in scope intersection
  - All updated pages link to new concept pages from WU-1911
  - pnpm docs:validate passes with zero errors
