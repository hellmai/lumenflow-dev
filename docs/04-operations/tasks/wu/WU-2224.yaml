description: CLI wu:* commands (wu:create, wu:claim, wu:done) write WU lifecycle events to local
  wu-events.jsonl but never push them to the configured control_plane endpoint. Gates already syncs
  telemetry to /api/v1/telemetry from CLI — the same pattern needs to exist for WU lifecycle events.
  Add a post-command sync flush that reuses existing control_plane config/token resolution to push
  WU lifecycle events after each wu:* command.
acceptance:
  - wu:create pushes a task.created event to control plane when control_plane config exists
  - wu:claim pushes a task.claimed event to control plane when control_plane config exists
  - wu:done pushes a task.completed event to control plane when control_plane config exists
  - 'Sync flush is non-blocking: failures are logged but do not break the CLI command'
  - Sync flush reuses existing control_plane config and token_env resolution from workspace.yaml
  - No sync attempt when control_plane config is absent (CLI-only workspaces unaffected)
