description: Replace (allow file-read*) with scoped read rules (workspace plus system paths only).
  Add deny overlay support for sensitive paths like ~/.ssh. Bring macOS backend to parity with Linux
  bwrap behavior.
acceptance:
  - macOS sandbox restricts file-read to workspace and system paths
  - Deny overlays block reads to sensitive paths like ~/.ssh
  - macOS sandbox behavior matches Linux bwrap confinement
