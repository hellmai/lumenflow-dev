tests:
  manual:
    - Reproduce a non-fast-forward scenario by advancing origin/main between merge and push
    - then run wu:done and confirm it rebases/retries instead of failing.
    - Inspect the resulting wu:done commit and verify Worktree-Branch and Worktree-Path provenance
      trailers are present.

  Root cause: WU-1467 push race condition. Plan: declarative-forging-pixel.md. New test file needed
  for generateCommitMessage provenance.

description: 'wu:done push step has no retry/sync logic. When origin/main advances between merge and
  push (concurrent agents), push fails with non-fast-forward. Agents improvise recovery with
  LUMENFLOW_FORCE, creating ghost commits. Fix: git pull --rebase before push (standard git
  pattern). Add provenance trailers for forensics.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done push succeeds when origin/main advances between merge and push
  - No error swallowing - rebase conflicts propagate clearly
  - Provenance trailers (Worktree-Branch, Worktree-Path) in wu:done commits
  - No hardcoded string literals - uses GIT_COMMANDS/GIT_FLAGS constants
  - All existing tests pass
  - Unit tests cover provenance trailer generation and pass
