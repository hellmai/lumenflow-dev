description: >-
  Context: wu:spawn currently emits hard-coded skill/agent path guidance (e.g. .claude/skills) and
  auto-load language that does not reflect actual configuration or repo state.


  Problem: guidance is inaccurate in vendor-agnostic installs, and CLI/core outputs diverge. The
  prompt should be configuration-driven, robust, and truthful for any installation.


  Solution: resolve skills/agents paths from .lumenflow.config.yaml (with per-client overrides),
  emit guidance based on actual config and path existence, and make CLI/core output consistent.
  Provide clear fallback when no skills are configured.
acceptance:
  - wu:spawn resolves skills/agents paths from config (client override -> directories default ->
    known existing fallback) and uses those paths in prompt output
  - If no skills directories are configured or found, wu:spawn emits a clear ‘no skills configured’
    guidance instead of misleading vendor-specific paths
  - CLI and core wu:spawn outputs are consistent for skills guidance (single source of truth or
    shared helper)
  - Auto-load skills section is either removed or re-enabled with real parsing, and behavior matches
    documentation
  - Unit tests cover path resolution and prompt output for claude-code, codex-cli, and generic
    clients
