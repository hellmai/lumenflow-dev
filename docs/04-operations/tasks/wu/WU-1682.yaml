description: Expand the existing Medium introduction article (medium-lumenflow-introduction.md) for the open-source launch. Corrects the narrative from a 23-day sprint to the real 6-month evolution across ExampleApp and the standalone repo. Adds new sections on state machines, initiatives, and invariants. Updates all stats to combined totals (15k+ commits, 1,943 WUs completed). Replaces all private language with open-source install instructions. Tone blends Paul Graham, Stephen Fry, Douglas Adams, Richard Dawkins, and Joel Spolsky.
acceptance:
  - Timeline reflects 6+ months of evolution, not 23 days
  - 'New section: State Machines, Not State Strings (conceptual + ASCII diagrams, no code)'
  - 'New section: Initiatives (multi-phase orchestration)'
  - 'New section: Invariants / test ratchet'
  - All private / if-you-have-access language removed
  - Stats updated to combined totals from both repos
  - Open-source CTA with npm install + GitHub link
  - Tone consistent with voice guide in plan
