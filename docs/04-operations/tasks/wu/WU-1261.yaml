description: |-
  Update wu:spawn to use resolvePolicy() for template selection. The spawn prompt should:
  1. Call resolvePolicy(config) to get the resolved methodology
  2. Select methodology template based on policy.testing (tdd/test-after/none)
  3. Select architecture template based on policy.architecture (hexagonal/layered/none)
  4. Include a 'You will be judged by' section derived from the resolved gate plan

  The spawn output must stay consistent with what gates will actually enforce.
acceptance:
  - wu:spawn calls resolvePolicy() to determine template selection
  - Methodology template selected based on policy.testing value
  - Architecture template selected based on policy.architecture value
  - Spawn prompt includes generated enforcement summary from resolved policy
  - Existing spawn output unchanged when using default methodology (tdd, hexagonal)
