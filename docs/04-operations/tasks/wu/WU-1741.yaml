description: 'Context: wu:prep for WU-1724 fails on pre-existing lint debt dominated by
  no-explicit-any in core/cli. Problem: strict TS is green but lifecycle gates still fail due to
  pre-existing lint violations. Solution: systematically replace unsafe any usage with explicit
  narrow types and guards in flagged modules so pnpm lint can pass without skip-gates.'
acceptance:
  - pnpm lint passes for the repo without relying on --skip-gates for pre-existing no-explicit-any
    failures in core/cli.
  - No behavior changes are introduced; added typings preserve runtime semantics and tests remain
    green.
