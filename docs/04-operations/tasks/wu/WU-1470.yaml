description: 'Context: docs generation tests execute pnpm docs:generate against repo root and can mutate tracked docs files in the active checkout. Problem: test runs from main can leave dirty tracked files and violate workflow discipline. Solution: snapshot and restore generated tracked files in test lifecycle hooks so suites remain side-effect free.'
acceptance:
  - docs-generate test suite snapshots cli.mdx, config.mdx, and CLI README before mutations
  - afterEach/afterAll restore tracked files to pre-test state
  - running docs-generate tests does not leave tracked file diffs
  - targeted test suite passes
