description: Remove current React act warnings emitted by workspace connector and marketplace detail tests by making async state updates explicit and deterministic in tests.
acceptance:
  - pnpm --filter @lumenflow/web test passes without React act warnings from touched tests
  - workspace connector tests remain behaviorally equivalent
  - marketplace install-command copy test remains behaviorally equivalent
