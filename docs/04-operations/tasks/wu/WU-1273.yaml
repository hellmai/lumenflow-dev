description: |
  Create integration tests for core WU lifecycle commands: wu:create, wu:claim, wu:status.
  Tests should use real file system operations in a temp directory and validate
  the full command flow including YAML generation, worktree creation, and status reporting.
acceptance:
  - Integration test for wu:create validates YAML output
  - Integration test for wu:claim creates worktree correctly
  - Integration test for wu:status reports accurate state
  - Tests run in CI without mocking filesystem
