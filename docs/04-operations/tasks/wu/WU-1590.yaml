description: 'Context: Cloud agents execute from existing feature branches and must complete the
  entire WU lifecycle without worktrees or direct main writes. Problem: wu:create, wu:claim,
  wu:prep, wu:done, and wu:cleanup still contain lane-derived branch assumptions and main-canonical
  update paths that break branch-pr operation. Solution: implement explicit cloud lifecycle paths
  that persist claimed_branch, respect current branch execution, validate against HEAD where
  required, and complete via PR + safe cleanup semantics.'
acceptance:
  - Add wu:create --cloud path that writes and commits WU specs on current branch without
    ensureOnMain or micro-worktree main updates.
  - Update wu:claim --cloud to persist claimed_branch and bypass remote/local branch-exists checks
    when claiming on the current branch.
  - Update wu:done branch-pr preflight to skip ensureOnMain and validate branch-pr code_paths
    against HEAD.
  - Ensure wu:prep branch-pr validates against claimed_branch via defaultBranchFrom() resolver
    precedence.
  - Update wu:cleanup to resolve claimed_branch, verify merged PR against that branch, skip
    worktree-only checks in branch-pr mode, and avoid deleting non-lane cloud-managed branches.
  - Add coverage for create/claim/prep/done/cleanup branch-pr paths.
