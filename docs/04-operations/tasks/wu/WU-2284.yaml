title: wu:claim lane occupancy should ignore non-active WUs in status sections
lane: 'Framework: Core Lifecycle'
type: bug
status: ready
priority: P1
created: 2026-03-01

tests:
  manual:
    - Create a fixture where status.md lists a superseded WU under In Progress in the same lane, then run wu:claim and verify claim is not blocked by that WU

description: 'Context: lane WIP enforcement in wu:claim reads status.md sections and lane-matches referenced WUs. Problem: WUs listed in status.md In Progress can still be counted toward WIP even when their YAML status is no longer active (for example superseded/cancelled/done), causing false lane blockage and force-claim pressure. Solution: update lane occupancy evaluation to filter candidates by canonical YAML status and count only active statuses under lane lock policy, with regression coverage for superseded ghost entries.'
acceptance:
  - wu:claim does not count superseded WUs toward lane WIP occupancy
  - wu:claim does not count done or cancelled WUs toward lane WIP occupancy
  - lane occupancy output still reports genuinely active blockers with correct IDs
  - regression tests cover stale status.md entries that reference non-active WUs
  - pnpm gates passes
