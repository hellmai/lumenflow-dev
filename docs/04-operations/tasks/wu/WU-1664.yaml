description: 'Context: worktree completion logic is concentrated in large lifecycle modules that encode multiple implicit steps and recovery transitions inline. Problem: this structure makes service boundaries unclear and complicates machine-driven orchestration and targeted testing. Solution: refactor worktree completion logic into explicit service boundaries consumed by the pipeline state machine, while preserving existing lifecycle behavior and branch-only compatibility.'
acceptance:
  - Worktree completion logic is decomposed into service-oriented units aligned with pipeline state responsibilities.
  - State-driven orchestration can invoke lifecycle services without changing branch-only/public completion semantics.
  - Existing lifecycle/worktree regression coverage continues to pass with no behavioral regressions.
  - Code structure clearly separates state orchestration concerns from git/worktree side-effect services.
