description: 'Context: worktree completion logic is concentrated in large lifecycle modules that
  encode multiple implicit steps and recovery transitions inline. Problem: this structure makes
  service boundaries unclear and complicates machine-driven orchestration and targeted testing.
  Solution: refactor worktree completion logic into explicit service boundaries consumed by the
  pipeline state machine, while preserving existing lifecycle behavior and branch-only
  compatibility.'
acceptance:
  - Worktree completion logic is decomposed into service-oriented units aligned with pipeline state
    responsibilities.
  - State-driven orchestration can invoke lifecycle services without changing branch-only/public
    completion semantics.
  - Existing lifecycle/worktree regression coverage continues to pass with no behavioral regressions.
  - Code structure clearly separates state orchestration concerns from git/worktree side-effect
    services.
