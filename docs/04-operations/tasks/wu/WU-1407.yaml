description: "Context: design-first skill catches over-engineering (saved 20+ lines in WU-1406).
  Problem: It's opt-in, so agents skip it. Solution: Add mandate to CLAUDE.md, LUMENFLOW.md, and
  wu-template.yaml. Scope: mandatory for feature/refactor WUs, optional for chores/ops/docs. No
  hooks, no automation—just docs."
