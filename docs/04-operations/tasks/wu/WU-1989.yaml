description: state:doctor reports false status mismatches for YAML statuses not representable in
  wu-events state (e.g., superseded) and marks unsupported transitions as auto-fixable. Tighten
  mismatch detection and auto-fix eligibility to only event-representable transitions.
acceptance:
  - state:doctor does not report mismatch for superseded WUs with ready/in_progress derived states
  - status mismatch issues expose canAutoFix=false for unsupported transitions
  - state-doctor core tests cover superseded skip and non-fixable transition behavior
