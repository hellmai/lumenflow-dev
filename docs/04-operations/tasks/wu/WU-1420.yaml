title: state:doctor should detect and fix YAML vs state store status mismatches

tests:
  manual:
    - Run state:doctor on a repo with YAML=ready but events show in_progress (no release), verify STATUS_MISMATCH detected
    - Run state:doctor --fix and verify release event emitted to reconcile state
    - Run wu:claim after fix and verify it succeeds

notes: |
  Implementation adds STATUS_MISMATCH issue type to state-doctor-core.ts.
  Detection: Derives status from events (claim->in_progress, release->ready, complete->done)
  and compares against YAML status field.
  Fix: Emits corrective events (release or complete) via micro-worktree isolation.

description: "Context: state:doctor checks for orphaned WUs, dangling signals, and broken events,
  but not YAML vs state store status mismatches. Problem: When WU YAML says 'ready' but state store
  says 'in_progress' (no release event after claim), wu:claim fails with 'already in_progress'.
  state:doctor reports healthy. Solution: Add STATUS_MISMATCH issue type that compares YAML status
  against state store derived status, and with --fix emits appropriate corrective events (e.g.,
  release for in_progress→ready)."
acceptance:
  - state:doctor detects when WU YAML status differs from state store derived status
  - state:doctor --fix emits corrective events (release, complete) to reconcile state
  - Documentation updated if state:doctor behavior changes
