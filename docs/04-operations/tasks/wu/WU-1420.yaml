description: "Context: state:doctor checks for orphaned WUs, dangling signals, and broken events, but not YAML vs state store status mismatches. Problem: When WU YAML says 'ready' but state store says 'in_progress' (no release event after claim), wu:claim fails with 'already in_progress'. state:doctor reports healthy. Solution: Add STATUS_MISMATCH issue type that compares YAML status against state store derived status, and with --fix emits appropriate corrective events (e.g., release for in_progress→ready)."
acceptance:
  - state:doctor detects when WU YAML status differs from state store derived status
  - state:doctor --fix emits corrective events (release, complete) to reconcile state
  - Documentation updated if state:doctor behavior changes
