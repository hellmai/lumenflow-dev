  clarifies when to create a minimal package.json for LumenFlow without changing the tech stack.
acceptance:
  - Quickstart explains how to handle non-Node projects (minimal package.json for LumenFlow only)
  - Allowed commands include pnpm init -y only with explicit user approval
  - Guidance states not to scaffold Node stacks for non-Node frameworks unless asked
