description: |
  Create integration tests for WU completion workflow: wu:prep and wu:done.
  Tests should validate gates execution, merge workflow, stamp creation,
  and worktree cleanup. Must test both success and failure paths.
acceptance:
  - Integration test for wu:prep runs gates in worktree
  - Integration test for wu:done merges and creates stamp
  - Test validates worktree cleanup after wu:done
  - Test covers skip-gates with reason workflow
