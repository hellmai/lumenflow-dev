description: 'Context: wu:delete uses micro-worktree isolation like wu:create. Problem: Pre-push
  hook blocks wu:delete pushes but allows wu:create. The hook does not recognize micro-worktree
  operations from wu:delete. Solution: Update pre-push hook to allow micro-worktree pushes from all
  CLI commands (wu:create, wu:delete, wu:edit, etc.).'
acceptance:
  - wu:delete can push without LUMENFLOW_FORCE
  - Hook recognizes micro-worktree pattern from all CLI commands
  - wu:create still works (regression test)
