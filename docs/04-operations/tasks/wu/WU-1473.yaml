description: 'Context: memory enforcement needs CLI lifecycle touchpoints after core hook and signal
  integrity work lands. Problem: orchestrator recovery and signal consumption are inconsistent
  across non-worktree and completion paths. Solution: wire unread signal surfacing and read-marking
  into claim/done flows and extend orchestrator recovery behavior in CLI hook generation.'
acceptance:
  - Pre-compact/session-start recovery supports non-worktree orchestrator context without breaking
    existing worktree behavior.
  - Claim/start surfaces unread signal summary so agents can consume pending coordination messages.
  - wu:done marks completed-WU signals as read using receipt-aware behavior from WU-1472.
  - CLI integrations remain fail-open and do not block primary WU lifecycle commands on memory
    errors.
