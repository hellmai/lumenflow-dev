description: 'Context: lifecycle fixes landed in src but runtime scripts execute dist, allowing
  stale command behavior and repair loops. Problem: wu:repair --all --check mutated state and
  wu:done/state flows missed source fixes because dist was stale. Solution: route critical lifecycle
  scripts through cli-entry and require fresh CLI/core build for those entries, with failing-first
  regression tests.'
acceptance:
  - 'TDD: failing-first test proves lifecycle scripts (wu:claim, wu:done, wu:repair, state:doctor)
    use tools/cli-entry.mjs.'
  - 'TDD: failing-first test proves cli-entry enforces fresh build for strict lifecycle entries even
    when dist exists.'
  - Implementation updates cli-entry build policy and package scripts so runtime reflects current
    src behavior for lifecycle flows.
  - 'Regression: pnpm wu:repair --all --check exits with detection-only status and does not create
    repair commits when inconsistencies exist.'
