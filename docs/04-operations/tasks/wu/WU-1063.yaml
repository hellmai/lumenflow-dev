description: |-
  Context: wu:edit normalizes WU YAML before validation.
  Problem: normalizeWUSchema currently deletes spec_refs, so any wu:edit run strips plan links and triggers missing spec_refs warnings.
  Solution: Preserve spec_refs during normalization and add coverage to prevent regression.
acceptance:
  - normalizeWUSchema preserves spec_refs (no deletion)
  - wu:edit keeps existing spec_refs after editing any other field
  - wu:validate no longer warns about missing spec_refs after wu:edit on feature WUs
