description: Expand MCP discovery/tools to include pack:list, pack:install, and workspace:info parity operations aligned with CLI and HTTP surface capabilities.
acceptance:
  - MCP listTools includes pack:list, pack:install, and workspace:info entries
  - Tool handlers route through runtime safely with error handling consistent with existing MCP commands
  - Parity tests cover the new MCP tool exposure and basic invocation contract
