  manual:
    - Run pnpm lumenflow:upgrade --latest in a repo where origin/main advances during push; command
      exits 0 and leaves no divergent local commit

notes: 'Implementation: add retry-path reconciliation in micro-worktree push retry. If ff-only merge
  of rebased temp branch into local main fails due divergence, rebase local main onto temp branch
  and continue push retry. Includes unit regressions for pushWithRetry and pushWithRetryConfig.'

description: When origin/main moves during upgrade, lumenflow:upgrade may complete package upgrade +
  push, then still emit fatal divergence failure from retry path. Make command idempotent and treat
  already-pushed result as success.
acceptance:
  - Upgrade returns success when target commit already exists on origin/main after retry path
  - No duplicate/local-only upgrade commit left behind after successful remote push
  - Regression test covers retry/remote-ahead path
