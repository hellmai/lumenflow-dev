description: 'The eslint-plugin-boundaries config uses patterns (application/, infrastructure/, shared/) that do not exist in the codebase. Only ports/ matches. Actual hex dirs in @lumenflow/core: usecases/, adapters/, domain/, schemas/. Three of four boundary rules are dead — architecture violations go uncaught. Fix: scope patterns to @lumenflow/core only using packages/@lumenflow/core/src/ prefix.'
acceptance:
  - boundaries/elements patterns scoped to packages/@lumenflow/core/src/ matching ports/**, usecases/**, adapters/**, domain/**, schemas/**
  - pnpm lint passes with updated config
  - Deliberate boundary violation (adapter importing usecase) is caught by lint rule
  - No regression in existing lint output for other packages
