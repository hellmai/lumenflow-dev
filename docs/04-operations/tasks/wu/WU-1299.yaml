description: When running gates with --docs-only, pre-existing test failures in unrelated packages
  (e.g., @lumenflow/initiatives, @lumenflow/core) block WU completion even when the WU only touches
  documentation files. The --docs-only flag should either truly skip code tests entirely, or better
  filter to only run tests in packages touched by the WU's code_paths.
acceptance:
  - When --docs-only is passed, tests in packages not in the WU code_paths are skipped
  - Pre-existing test failures in unrelated packages don't block docs-only WUs
  - Clear messaging when tests are skipped due to --docs-only mode
