title: lumenflow init should scaffold package.json with CLI scripts
lane: 'Framework: CLI WU Commands'

tests:
  manual:
    - Run lumenflow init in an empty directory and verify pnpm wu:create works

notes: Added @lumenflow/cli ^3.0.0 to devDependencies in the injectPackageJsonScripts function of
  init.ts. Follows the same pattern as the existing prettier dependency injection. New constant
  CLI_PACKAGE_VERSION and CLI_PACKAGE_NAME. 8 new tests in init-package-json.test.ts covering fresh
  dir, existing package.json, force mode, and script+dep co-presence.

description: 'Context: lumenflow init generates 35+ config files but does not create or update
  package.json. Problem: After running lumenflow init in a fresh project, users cannot run any
  LumenFlow commands (wu:create, wu:claim, gates, etc.) because there is no package.json with
  @lumenflow/cli dependency or lifecycle scripts. Solution: lumenflow init should either create a
  package.json with the CLI dependency and standard scripts, or detect an existing package.json and
  inject the required scripts and dependency.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow init in a fresh directory creates package.json with @lumenflow/cli dependency
  - lumenflow init in a directory with existing package.json adds scripts without overwriting
    existing content
  - After lumenflow init, pnpm wu:create and pnpm gates work without manual setup
