description: Mechanically split packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-edit.ts into dedicated validation and
  edit-operation modules while keeping existing command contract and behavior.
acceptance:
  - Validation helpers are extracted and reused by wu-edit orchestrator without behavior changes.
  - Edit/apply operations are extracted into focused modules and preserve current semantics.
  - CLI output and exit behavior for wu:edit remain unchanged.
