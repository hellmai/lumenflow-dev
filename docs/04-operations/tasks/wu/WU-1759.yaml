description: EventStore file lock has no stale-lock detection — process crash permanently bricks the store. claimTask/completeTask emit two events with separate appends — crash between them corrupts task state. Need stale-lock detection (PID+timestamp) and batch appendAll method for atomic multi-event writes.
acceptance:
  - File lock writes PID and timestamp into lock file
  - Stale lock detected and recovered when owning process is dead
  - New appendAll method writes multiple events under single lock
  - claimTask and completeTask use appendAll for atomic writes
