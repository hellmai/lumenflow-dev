description: 'Context: pnpm audit currently reports two HIGH vulnerabilities affecting @modelcontextprotocol/sdk and @isaacs/brace-expansion, and CI does not enforce audit checks. Problem: release readiness is blocked by unresolved security risk and missing supply-chain gate enforcement. Solution: upgrade or override vulnerable dependencies and add an audit step in CI with moderate threshold enforcement.'
acceptance:
  - pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate reports no high or critical vulnerabilities
  - '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk is upgraded to a patched version'
  - brace-expansion vulnerability is remediated via direct or transitive update
  - CI runs pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate as a required gate
