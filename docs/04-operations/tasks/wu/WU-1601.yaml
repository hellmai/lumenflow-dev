description: The Codex client path in wu:spawn returns before registry persistence, so --parent-wu lineage is silently dropped for Codex output while other clients persist correctly. This creates false negatives in delegation provenance and inconsistent behavior between clients.
acceptance:
  - wu:spawn with --client codex-cli --parent-wu records a spawn registry entry exactly once.
  - Non-Codex spawn paths preserve existing registry behavior without duplicate writes.
  - Automated tests cover registry persistence for both Codex and non-Codex execution paths.
