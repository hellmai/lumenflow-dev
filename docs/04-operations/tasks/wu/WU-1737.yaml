description: 'Context: INIT-029 Phase 4 — Surfaces + Daemon. Depends on WU-1736 (CLI tracer bullet).
  Problem: After the tracer bullet proves KernelRuntime works for lifecycle commands, all remaining
  CLI commands need to be rewritten as thin KernelRuntime wrappers. Solution: Rewrite gates,
  orchestration, inspect, replay, and remaining CLI commands to call KernelRuntime instead of
  importing core directly. lumenflow inspect shows full execution trace with receipts and policy
  decisions. lumenflow replay re-executes from stored CAS inputs. Plan:
  .claude/plans/golden-prancing-cookie.md'
acceptance:
  - Gates command runs gate policies through PolicyEngine (not hardcoded gate runner)
  - Orchestration commands (monitor, init-status) work through KernelRuntime
  - 'lumenflow inspect shows: task state, run history, tool receipts, policy decisions, evidence'
  - lumenflow replay can re-execute a run from stored CAS inputs
  - All CLI commands have zero direct imports from @lumenflow/core
  - CLI surface package depends only on @lumenflow/kernel, not @lumenflow/core
