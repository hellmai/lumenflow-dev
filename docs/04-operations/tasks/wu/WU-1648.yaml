description: Mechanically decompose packages/@lumenflow/initiatives/src/initiative-orchestrator.ts into domain-focused modules for execution planning, checkpointing, and formatting/orchestration output.
acceptance:
  - initiative-orchestrator.ts becomes a thin composition layer importing extracted domain modules.
  - Execution plan generation and orchestrate output behavior remain unchanged.
  - Existing initiative orchestration contracts remain backward compatible.
