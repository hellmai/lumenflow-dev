description: WU-2061 removed micro-worktree isolation from the release script, replacing it with
  direct-on-main writes. This regressed WU-1077 which fixed release to work entirely in
  micro-worktree. The direct-on-main approach breaks cleanup when dist symlinks are no longer
  tracked in git (WU-2206). Release must use withMicroWorktree like all other tooling commands.
acceptance:
  - Release script uses withMicroWorktree for all writes
  - No direct writes to main checkout during release
  - pnpm release --dry-run shows micro-worktree flow
  - pnpm release --skip-publish succeeds end-to-end
  - Cleanup on failure leaves main completely untouched
