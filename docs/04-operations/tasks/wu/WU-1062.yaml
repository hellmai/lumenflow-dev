    - wu:create --id WU-TEST --plan creates spec branch + external plan
    - wu:create --id WU-TEST --direct writes to main (legacy behavior)
    - wu:claim --id WU-TEST merges spec branch before creating worktree

spec_refs:
  - internal
risks:
  - External plans not version-controlled by default
  - Breaking change if wu:claim assumes WU always on main
notes: >-
  Bootstrap WU: external plan stored in lumenflow://plans/; spec_refs intentionally external until
  validator updated in WU-1062.


  Reopened: CLI integration incomplete; finishing spec-branch + external plan workflow.

  Reset to ready for re-claim after reopen.

description: >
  Define $LUMENFLOW_HOME for external storage (~/.lumenflow/). Store plans in $LUMENFLOW_HOME/plans/
  instead of repo. Make wu:create operate in spec branch by default (spec/wu-XXXX), never writing to
  main directly. Update wu:claim to merge spec branch to main before creating worktree. Add --direct
  flag for legacy main-write behavior.
acceptance:
  - $LUMENFLOW_HOME env var defined with default ~/.lumenflow/
  - getLumenflowHome() and getPlansDir() helpers exported from @lumenflow/core
  - spec_refs validation accepts external paths (~/.lumenflow/..., $LUMENFLOW_HOME/...)
  - spec_refs warning in wu-spawn updated to handle external paths
  - wu:create defaults to spec branch mode (creates spec/wu-XXXX branch, no main writes)
  - wu:create --plan creates plan template in $LUMENFLOW_HOME/plans/
  - wu:create --direct preserves current main-write behavior (legacy/emergency)
  - arg-parser.ts defines WU_CREATE_OPTIONS with --plan and --direct flags
  - wu:claim detects if WU exists only on spec branch (not main)
  - wu:claim merges spec/wu-XXXX to main before creating worktree
  - wu:claim fails gracefully if spec branch doesn't exist and WU not on main
  - Existing in-repo plans remain valid (no breaking change)
  - WUs already on main work without spec branch merge
  - LUMENFLOW.md updated with new wu:create flow
  - playbook.md updated with spec branch pattern
  - quick-ref-commands.md updated with new flags
