description: "Context: ExampleApp reported guard-locked, guard-main-branch, guard-worktree-commit
  CLI commands don't recognize worktree context properly. Problem: Commands fail to detect when
  running from a worktree. Solution: Update guards to use proper worktree detection like other CLI
  commands."
acceptance:
  - guard-locked recognizes worktree context
  - guard-main-branch recognizes worktree context
  - guard-worktree-commit recognizes worktree context
  - Tests cover worktree detection
