notes: Refactor wu:done docs-only policy to eliminate raw type/exposure string comparisons and lock
  the behavior in with a guardrail test. Also fix safe-git LUMENFLOW_FORCE audit logging to write to
  .lumenflow/force-bypasses.log (matching core constants/tests), while continuing to write to
  .lumenflow/* only when that legacy directory already exists.

description: 'Context: WU-1444 centralized WU type helper predicates in @lumenflow/core. Problems:
  (1) wu:done contained raw string comparisons for documentation type/exposure in docs-only policy
  validation, increasing drift risk and reducing type-safety. (2) safe-git LUMENFLOW_FORCE bypass
  logging wrote to a legacy location, causing drift vs core constants and failing tests. Solution:
  refactor wu:done to use core helpers/constants for documentation checks with a guardrail unit
  test, and align safe-git bypass logging to .lumenflow (with legacy dual-write when .lumenflow
  exists).'
acceptance:
  - wu:done docs-only validation uses core helper(s)/constants for documentation type/exposure
    checks (no raw string comparisons in the policy logic)
  - Added a guardrail unit test that fails if raw string comparisons are reintroduced
  - safe-git writes LUMENFLOW_FORCE bypass audit entries to .lumenflow/force-bypasses.log
  - pnpm gates passes
