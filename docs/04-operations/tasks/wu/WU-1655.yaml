title: Fix wu:claim no-remote regressions left after WU-1653
lane: 'Framework: CLI WU Commands'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-13

tests:
  manual:
    - In a repo with git.requireRemote=false and no origin remote, run wu:create then wu:claim and
      verify WU metadata updates + commit succeed without remote errors.

description: 'Context: WU-1653 added remote-skip guards, but review found claim paths that still
  depend on origin/main or skip metadata updates when git.requireRemote=false. Problem: wu:claim can
  fail or under-apply state updates in no-remote mode, especially around canonical-update gating,
  baseline SHA sourcing, and branch-only flow. Solution: make no-remote behavior explicit and
  consistent across claim flows, with deterministic fallback to local main where appropriate and
  targeted tests for requireRemote=false.'
acceptance:
  - Worktree-mode wu:claim with git.requireRemote=false and no origin remote succeeds without remote
    calls and still writes/commits expected claim metadata.
  - No-remote path does not skip required metadata updates when canonical claim update is disabled.
  - Baseline SHA assignment in claim metadata works without origin/main (uses a safe local fallback).
  - Branch-only claim flow has no hidden origin dependency in no-remote mode (either supported with
    local fallback and no push, or blocked early with a clear preflight error before mutation).
  - Targeted unit coverage added for requireRemote=false claim behavior and existing wu:claim test
    suites continue passing.
