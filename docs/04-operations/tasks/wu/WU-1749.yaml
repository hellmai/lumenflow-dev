description: Upgrade all outdated dependencies across the monorepo. Safe semver-compatible bumps (vitest, zod, commander, simple-git, turbo, typescript-eslint, minimatch, eslint plugins, astro/starlight) plus evaluated major bumps (glob, p-retry, ps-list). Hold ESLint 10 and @types/node 25.
acceptance:
  - All semver-compatible deps upgraded to latest
  - Major bumps (glob, p-retry, ps-list) evaluated and upgraded if safe
  - ESLint 10 and @types/node 25 held at current majors
  - pnpm install succeeds with no lockfile drift
  - Full build passes (pnpm build)
  - Tests pass across all packages
