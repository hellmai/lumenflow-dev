notes: 'TDD execution: added a failing contract test requiring canonical CLAIMED_MODES import and no
  fallback shim in wu-state-cloud.ts, then removed fallback try/catch/object and wired direct
  CLAIMED_MODES usage. Updated wu-delete test mock to include CLAIMED_MODES so tests remain explicit
  and deterministic. Verified with: pnpm exec vitest run
  src/__tests__/wu-state-commands-cloud.test.ts src/__tests__/wu-delete.test.ts (11/11 passing).'

description: Remove the runtime fallback in wu-state-cloud.ts and rely on canonical CLAIMED_MODES
  from @lumenflow/core. Update tests/mocks to provide CLAIMED_MODES explicitly so behavior is
  deterministic and hardcoding is eliminated.
acceptance:
  - wu-state-cloud.ts uses canonical CLAIMED_MODES import directly with no local fallback object or
    try/catch
  - Tests pass with explicit CLAIMED_MODES in mocks where needed; no implicit fallback dependency
  - No behavior regression for branch-pr state path selection across
