description: 'Context: coverage runs fail due to missing @vitest/coverage-v8 in several packages.
  Problem: pnpm test -- --coverage errors in core/cli/agent/initiatives/memory. Solution: add
  coverage provider devDependency where missing and update tooling docs.'
acceptance:
  - Add @vitest/coverage-v8 devDependency to packages that run coverage but lack it
    (core/cli/agent/initiatives/memory).
  - pnpm test -- --coverage runs without coverage provider resolution errors.
  - Documentation updated to mention coverage provider requirement for Vitest.
