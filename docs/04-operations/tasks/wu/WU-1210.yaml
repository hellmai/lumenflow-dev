  Fix: Change default for progress_signals.enabled from false to true so "Required at Milestones" is
  shown by default.

  Also fixed lint errors in CLI wu-spawn.ts (WU-1205 scope) and added missing CLI docs to README.

  Pre-release blockers:
  1. wu-spawn.test.ts failing 'Required at Milestones' assertion (progress_signals default)
  2. CLI wu-spawn.ts lint errors (console statements, cognitive complexity)
  3. Missing CLI command documentation in README
  4. Runtime directories missing from gitignore
acceptance:
  - "Test passes: generateTaskInvocation output contains 'Required at Milestones'"
  - All wu-spawn tests pass (39 tests)
  - wu-spawn.ts has no lint errors (only warnings allowed)
  - README documents signal-cleanup, state-cleanup, state-doctor, lumenflow-doctor commands
  - pre-release:check passes
