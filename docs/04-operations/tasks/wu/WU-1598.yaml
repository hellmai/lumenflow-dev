description: 'Context: INIT-023 still has open review findings. Finding #3 reports that wu:claim --cloud mutates canonical state on origin/main via push-only micro-worktree. Finding #7 reports a DRY constant divergence in wu-state-cloud.ts. Finding #8 reports insufficient integration coverage for real cloud lifecycle execution paths. Problem: these remain open at pre-release and leave behavior/policy ambiguity plus test blind spots. Solution: implement the agreed canonical-claim behavior for branch-pr claims, remove state constant duplication by importing canonical CLAIMED_MODES, and add deterministic integration coverage that exercises real lifecycle command paths and catches regressions.'
acceptance:
  - Branch-pr claim path behavior for canonical state is explicitly enforced in code and documented in command-level tests (no ambiguous mixed behavior).
  - wu-state-cloud.ts uses canonical CLAIMED_MODES constants instead of local string literals for branch modes.
  - Cloud lifecycle integration tests cover create/claim/prep/done/cleanup command flow assertions relevant to branch-pr regressions.
  - Existing non-cloud worktree lifecycle behavior remains unchanged and existing tests continue to pass.
