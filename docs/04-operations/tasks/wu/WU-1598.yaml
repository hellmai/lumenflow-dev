description: 'Context: INIT-023 still has open review findings. Finding #3 reports that wu:claim
  --cloud mutates canonical state on origin/main via push-only micro-worktree. Finding #7 reports a
  DRY constant divergence in wu-state-cloud.ts. Finding #8 reports insufficient integration coverage
  for real cloud lifecycle execution paths. Problem: these remain open at pre-release and leave
  behavior/policy ambiguity plus test blind spots. Solution: implement the agreed canonical-claim
  behavior for branch-pr claims, remove state constant duplication by importing canonical
  CLAIMED_MODES, and add deterministic integration coverage that exercises real lifecycle command
  paths and catches regressions.'
acceptance:
  - wu:claim --cloud in branch-pr mode does not perform canonical push-only claim updates to
    origin/main.
  - Branch-pr claim metadata/state updates are committed to the claimed working branch, while
    non-cloud worktree claim behavior remains unchanged.
  - wu-state-cloud.ts uses canonical CLAIMED_MODES constants instead of local string literals for
    branch modes.
  - Cloud lifecycle integration tests cover create/claim/prep/done/cleanup regressions relevant to
    branch-pr execution and canonical-claim behavior.
