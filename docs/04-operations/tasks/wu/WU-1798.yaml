description: 'Context: MCP tools need to call runtime.executeTool() which requires a valid ExecutionContext. Problem: many MCP tools execute outside any task context (e.g., lane_health, validate), so there is no natural run_id/session_id/task_id. Also need a standard migration helper for the strangler-fig pattern. Solution: create an execution context builder that synthesizes maintenance contexts, and an executeViaPack helper that tries the runtime path first with CLI fallback.'
acceptance:
  - Execution context builder produces valid ExecutionContext for both task-scoped and maintenance (non-task) invocations
  - executeViaPack(toolName, input, options) helper tries runtime path first, falls back to runCliCommand on error
  - Helper is importable from @lumenflow/mcp for use by all domain tool files
