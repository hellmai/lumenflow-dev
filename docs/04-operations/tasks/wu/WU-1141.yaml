description: wu:cleanup fails with 'PR is not merged' error even when the PR is confirmed merged via gh pr view. The gh_api verification method returns false positive failures, blocking worktree cleanup after successful PR merges.
acceptance:
  - wu:cleanup correctly detects merged PRs via GitHub API
  - wu:cleanup succeeds for PRs that gh pr view confirms as MERGED
  - Add integration test for PR merge verification
