description: 'Context: wu:claim micro-worktree isolation should be fully atomic. Problem: when wu:claim fails partway (e.g. gitignore conflict on state files), WU YAML status can be left at ready instead of in_progress, requiring manual wu:repair --claim. Solution: add rollback/cleanup for all failure paths in wu:claim.'
acceptance:
  - If wu:claim fails after YAML modification but before commit, YAML is rolled back
  - If wu:claim fails after micro-worktree commit but before merge, temp branch is cleaned up
  - State store only gets a claim event on full success
  - After a failed wu:claim, re-running wu:claim succeeds without needing wu:repair
