description: WU-1859/1860 added try/catch on recordTrace (success path, tool-host.ts:239-249), but
  appendTrace for started events (line 179) and recordDeniedTrace calls (lines 202-215, 226-232,
  314-327, 373-380) still throw uncaught. These propagate through executeViaPack's catch block and
  fall through to CLI, since thrown errors have no error code in the denylist. A trace
  infrastructure failure should never trigger a policy-bypassing CLI fallback.
acceptance:
  - appendTrace for TOOL_CALL_STARTED (line 179) is wrapped in try/catch that does not suppress the
    tool execution
  - recordDeniedTrace calls are wrapped in try/catch — denied output is still returned to caller
  - No trace infrastructure failure can cause executeViaPack to fall through to CLI
  - Test coverage for trace-write failure during started/denied paths
