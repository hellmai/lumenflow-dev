description: Pre-release checks fail because several CLI bin aliases are present in package.json but
  missing from the CLI README. Document the missing aliases so release validation passes.
acceptance:
  - pnpm pre-release:check passes with no missing bin-entry errors
  - README lists wu-escalate, templates-sync, lumenflow-pre-commit-check, and state-emit
