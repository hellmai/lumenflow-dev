description: Split from WU-1888. Migrate state-transition maintenance commands (wu:block, wu:unblock, wu:release, wu:recover, wu:repair) from fallback/stub execution to native software-delivery pack handlers with resolver wiring and parity coverage.
acceptance:
  - wu:block, wu:unblock, wu:release, wu:recover, and wu:repair execute through software-delivery handlers in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for these state-transition maintenance commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration mode
