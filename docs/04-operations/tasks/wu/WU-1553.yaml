notes: 'Bug is on line ~205: filter uses STATE_FILE_PREFIX (.lumenflow/state/) but archive files are
  in .lumenflow/archive/. Fix: add ARCHIVE_FILE_PREFIX or use a broader LUMENFLOW_PREFIX
  (.lumenflow/) filter. ExampleApp workaround: cleanup.trigger: manual.'

description: commitCleanupChanges() in wu-done-auto-cleanup.ts only stages .lumenflow/state/* files
  via STATE_FILE_PREFIX filter. But archiveWuEvents() (WU-1430) also creates/modifies
  .lumenflow/archive/* files during cleanup. These archive files are never staged or committed,
  leaving main dirty after wu:done. Reported by ExampleApp consumer.
acceptance:
  - commitCleanupChanges stages both .lumenflow/state/* and .lumenflow/archive/* files
  - Tests cover archive file staging in wu-done-auto-cleanup.test.ts
  - Main checkout is clean after wu:done when archival runs
