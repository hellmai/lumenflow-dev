    - Verify `pnpm build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
    - Verify `pnpm test --filter @lumenflow/core` passes

notes: Completes the beacon to lumenflow migration for config schema. Agent names like
  beacon-guardian are unchanged as they are distinct from the config key.

description: "Context: WU-1421 renamed .beacon/ directory but config schema still uses 'beacon' key.
  Problem: ~55 files still reference 'beacon' including BeaconPathsSchema, config.beacon.*, and
  documentation. Solution: Rename BeaconPathsSchema→StatePathsSchema (or LumenflowPathsSchema),
  config.beacon→config.state, update all references in code and docs. Keep beacon-migration.ts as
  utility for users migrating from older versions."
acceptance:
  - BeaconPathsSchema renamed to StatePathsSchema or LumenflowPathsSchema
  - config.beacon.* renamed to config.state.* throughout codebase
  - All documentation references to beacon updated
  - Only beacon-migration.ts and its tests may reference 'beacon' (migration utility)
  - rg beacon --type ts returns only beacon-migration files
