description: validateWorkspaceRootKeys (kernel.schemas.ts:245) called at runtime boot (kernel-runtime.ts:1358) rejects any root key not in KERNEL_OWNED_ROOT_KEYS or declared by a pinned pack config_key. software_delivery is intentionally not kernel-owned (kernel.schemas.ts:205). WU-2193 made new workspaces pin SD by default, but pre-existing workspaces with packs:[] + software_delivery:{...} now hard-fail at boot with 'Unknown workspace root key software_delivery'. Need explicit migration path with clear error message and one-step remediation — not a silent fallback.
acceptance:
  - Runtime boot detects legacy workspace shape (software_delivery present, no SD pack pinned) and emits an actionable migration error with one-step remediation command or instructions
  - No silent fallback or auto-migration — user must explicitly act
  - Workspaces that have already pinned SD pack continue to boot normally
  - 'Migration tests cover: legacy workspace rejected with actionable message, migrated workspace boots cleanly, workspace without software_delivery boots cleanly'
