      exit codes from CLI boundary.

description: 'Context: multiple core library modules call process.exit directly. Problem:
  library-level exits break composition, make behavior inconsistent, and reduce testability.
  Solution: replace exit calls with typed throws and centralize process exit behavior at CLI entry
  boundaries.'
acceptance:
  - Core modules replace process.exit calls with typed errors and preserve existing error messages.
  - CLI entry wrappers remain the only process exit boundary and map typed errors to exit codes.
  - Regression tests cover known exit paths including initiative-remove-wu behavior.
