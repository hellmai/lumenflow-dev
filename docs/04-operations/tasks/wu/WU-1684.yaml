tests:
  manual:
    - Run wu:sandbox --id WU-XXXX -- bash and verify agent process starts inside sandbox
    - From inside sandbox, attempt to write to main checkout source file and verify EPERM
    - From inside sandbox, read main checkout files and verify reads work normally
    - From inside sandbox, run git commit in worktree and verify git operations work
    - With bwrap uninstalled, run wu:sandbox and verify graceful degradation warning
    - From inside sandbox, attempt write via ../ traversal outside worktree and verify deny
      (EPERM/EACCES).
    - From inside sandbox, create symlink in worktree to main checkout and verify writes through
      symlink are denied.
    - Without bwrap and without explicit override, run wu:sandbox and verify fail-closed non-zero
      exit.
    - With explicit unsandboxed override enabled, verify warning is emitted and command runs
      unsandboxed.

notes: 'Design references: Anthropic sandbox-runtime
  (github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) uses bwrap on Linux with asymmetric defaults
  (read=allow, write=deny). Codex issue #7071 shows that making .git read-only via chmod breaks git
  entirely — must use process-level namespaces instead. This is Layer 1 in a defense-in-depth model:
  (L1) kernel sandbox via bwrap, (L2) git pre-commit hooks, (L3) client-specific hooks, (L4) prompt
  instructions. Future: wu:claim could auto-detect bwrap and offer --sandbox by default. macOS
  support via sandbox-exec is a follow-up WU. | 2026-02-15 refinement: fail-closed defaults,
  explicit override semantics, escape-path validation (traversal + symlink). | Defense layer
  analysis: sandbox is ADDITIVE, not replacive. Existing layers protect against distinct concerns:
  (1) deny rules = destructive git ops (force-push, reset --hard) — sandbox cannot cover these since
  .git must stay writable, (2) bash-blocker = tool hygiene (use Grep not grep) — orthogonal to
  filesystem isolation, (3) pre-commit YAML validation = data integrity — orthogonal. One
  simplification opportunity: validate-worktree-path.sh (256 lines) could reduce to ~40-line
  audit-only stub once sandbox is standard, since kernel handles the actual write blocking.
  validate-worktree-discipline.sh (101 lines) could reduce to ~30-line human-only fallback. Net:
  ~350 lines simplifiable out of 1077 total defense code.'

description: 'Context: LumenFlow uses git worktrees to isolate agent work, but enforcement that
  agents stay inside their worktree is currently client-specific (Claude Code hooks in
  .claude/settings.json). Other agent clients (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI) only get git pre-commit
  hooks at commit time — too late, the agent has already written to the wrong place. Problem: No
  vendor-agnostic mechanism prevents agents from writing to the main checkout at file-write time.
  The current defense layers are: (1) git pre-commit hooks (vendor-agnostic but fire at commit time,
  not write time), (2) Claude PreToolUse hooks (fire at write time but Claude-only), (3) prompt
  instructions/skills (unreliable). The gap is a kernel-enforced, vendor-agnostic write barrier that
  works for ANY agent process. Solution: Add a wu:sandbox CLI command that wraps agent processes in
  Linux bubblewrap (bwrap) with write access restricted to the claimed worktree. Uses the same
  asymmetric model as Anthropic sandbox-runtime: reads allowed everywhere (deny-listed), writes
  denied everywhere (allow-listed). The sandbox resolves the worktree path from the WU ID and
  constructs bwrap arguments automatically. Key design: .git/ stays readable (shared objects),
  worktree gets write access, /tmp allowed, .lumenflow/state/ allowed for event logging, WU YAML
  path allowed for status updates. Falls back gracefully when bwrap is not installed (warn +
  continue).'
acceptance:
  - wu:sandbox --id WU-XXXX -- <command> wraps the given command in a bubblewrap sandbox with write
    access restricted to the WU worktree
  - Write attempts to main checkout source files from inside the sandbox fail with EPERM
    (kernel-enforced)
  - Read access to main checkout, .git/, node_modules/ works normally from inside the sandbox
  - Git operations (commit, add, status) work correctly inside the sandboxed worktree
  - pnpm/node operations work inside the sandbox (node_modules readable, /tmp writable)
  - 'Sandbox allow-list includes: worktree dir, /tmp, .lumenflow/state/, WU YAML path, /proc, /dev
    (for node)'
  - .lumenflow.config.yaml gets a new sandbox section for configuring allow/deny paths
  - 'Fail-closed default: when bwrap is not installed, wu:sandbox exits non-zero unless explicit
    LUMENFLOW_SANDBOX_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED=1 override is set (warns and runs unsandboxed)'
  - wu:claim --sandbox flag auto-wraps the agent session in the sandbox after worktree creation
  - Integration test proves that a sandboxed process cannot write to main but can write to its
    worktree
  - Sandbox denies path-escape writes via ../ traversal and symlink traversal outside the claimed
    worktree
