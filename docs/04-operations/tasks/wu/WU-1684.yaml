description: 'Context: Validator Layer V2 introduces phase-aware rules, but follow-up cleanup is needed to fully remove adapter drift. Problem: validation issue shaping and warnings are still mapped in more than one place, increasing regression risk. Solution: consolidate result normalization, reduce duplicate adapter paths, and keep CLI/public behavior stable.'
acceptance:
  - Shared validation issue-shaping path is used by lint and preflight adapters.
  - CLI create/edit/validate/prep/done consume normalized results without duplicate mapping logic.
  - Targeted regression tests confirm backward-compatible CLI behavior and warning/error presentation.
