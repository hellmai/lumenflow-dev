description: The release script (release.ts) only discovers packages under packages/@lumenflow/* via findPackageJsonPaths(). The new bare lumenflow wrapper at packages/lumenflow is excluded, causing version drift between scoped and unscoped packages.
acceptance:
  - findPackageJsonPaths includes packages/lumenflow/package.json
  - publishConfig.dependencies uses workspace:^ for auto-resolution
  - Release script bumps all packages atomically including the wrapper
