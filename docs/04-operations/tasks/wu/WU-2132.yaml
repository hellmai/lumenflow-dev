description: Add lifecycle enforcement so feature/bug WUs must provide TDD provenance before
  completion. Capture wu:brief execution evidence in WU state and require that evidence during
  wu:prep/wu:done unless an explicit force-bypass reason is supplied. This closes the gap where
  agents can skip brief context and implement without test-first discipline.
acceptance:
  - wu:brief writes auditable execution evidence tied to WU ID and timestamp
  - wu:prep fails feature/bug WUs when no TDD evidence exists in working diff (tests touched) and no
    explicit documented exception
  - wu:done validates wu:brief evidence exists for claimed WU before completion, with force-bypass
    audit path unchanged
  - CLI unit tests cover pass/fail paths for new enforcement in wu:brief, wu:prep, wu:done
