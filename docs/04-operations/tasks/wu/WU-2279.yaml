description: "Context: state:doctor --fix initiative status reconciliation uses micro-worktree
  operation name 'state:doctor'. Problem: colon in operation name generates temp branch ref
  tmp/state:doctor/... which git rejects as invalid, so auto-fix fails. Solution: use a branch-safe
  operation identifier for this path and add regression coverage."
acceptance:
  - pnpm state:doctor --fix no longer fails with invalid branch-name errors for tmp/state:doctor/*
  - initiative lifecycle status fixes run through micro-worktree path successfully when mismatches
    are fixable
  - state-doctor regression test asserts branch-safe micro-worktree operation usage
