description: 'Context: quickstart shows a minimal wu:create command that fails in practice. Problem: new users hit validation errors and churn during onboarding. Solution: update quickstart with a complete working wu:create example (description, acceptance, exposure, code_paths, test_paths) and call out automated test requirement.'
acceptance:
  - Quickstart includes a complete, working wu:create example with required flags
  - Quickstart explicitly notes automated test requirement for code WUs
