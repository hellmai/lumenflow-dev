    - Execute agent:session and agent:session-end through runtime path and verify expected session lifecycle behavior

notes: 'Sizing: Simple (expected 8-12 files, <50 tool calls). Strategy: Single Session. Gap identified during INIT-030 Phase 6 dry-run audit — these 4 agent tools were not covered by any existing WU.'

description: 'Gap fill: agent:session, agent:session-end, agent:log-issue, and agent:issues-query have in-process handlers in runtime-tool-resolver.ts but are not assigned to any Phase 6 migration WU. These 4 tools must be migrated from resolver fallback stubs to native software-delivery pack handlers.'
acceptance:
  - agent:session, agent:session-end, agent:log-issue, and agent:issues-query execute through software-delivery handlers in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated agent integration commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated agent commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration mode
