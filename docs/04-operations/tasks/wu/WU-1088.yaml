notes: |
  Solution: Extracted detectCycles function from @lumenflow/initiatives to @lumenflow/core
  as a new cycle-detector.ts module. This breaks the circular dependency because:
  - @lumenflow/core no longer imports from @lumenflow/initiatives (removed top-level await)
  - @lumenflow/initiatives imports detectCycles from @lumenflow/core (one-way dependency)
  - Backward compatibility maintained via re-exports

description: >-
  Context: dependency-graph.ts dynamically imports @lumenflow/initiatives at the top level to avoid
  circular dependencies at build time.


  Problem: At runtime, this creates a top-level await warning: 'Detected unsettled top-level await
  at dependency-graph.js:10'. This blocks orchestrate:initiative and other commands that depend on
  dependency-graph.ts. The circular dependency exists because @lumenflow/core imports
  @lumenflow/initiatives which imports @lumenflow/core.


  Solution: Refactor to break the circular dependency - either move shared types to a separate
  package, use lazy imports only where needed, or restructure the module graph to eliminate the
  cycle.
acceptance:
  - orchestrate:initiative command runs without top-level await warnings
  - No circular dependency between @lumenflow/core and @lumenflow/initiatives
  - All existing tests pass
  - pnpm turbo build completes without warnings
