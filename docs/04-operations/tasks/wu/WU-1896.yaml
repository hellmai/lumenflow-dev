notes: 'Sizing: Medium (expected 20-35 files, 50-100 tool calls). Strategy: Checkpoint-Resume. Split
  rationale: separates memory-family migration from other command families in WU-1889.'

description: Split from WU-1889. Migrate memory command surfaces (mem:init, mem:checkpoint,
  mem:recover, mem:inbox, and related memory ops) from fallback/stub execution to native
  software-delivery pack handlers with resolver wiring and parity coverage.
acceptance:
  - Memory command surfaces execute through software-delivery handlers in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated memory commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated memory commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration
    mode
