    - Run runtime capability resolution for manifest-declared tools and verify default permission
      resolves to read when unspecified while declared permission/scopes are honored.

description: 'Problem: runtime manifest tools currently receive hardcoded admin permission and broad
  scopes by default. Add permission/scope fields to manifest and make resolver honor least privilege
  by defaulting to read when unspecified.'
acceptance:
  - Manifest schema supports per-tool permission (read|write|admin).
  - Manifest schema supports per-tool required_scopes.
  - Runtime capability resolver reads permission/scopes from manifest instead of hardcoded
    admin/full-scope defaults.
  - Tools without explicit permission default to read.
  - Pack tool descriptor permissions and manifest permissions are aligned and covered by tests.
