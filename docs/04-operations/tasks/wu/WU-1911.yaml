description: 'INIT-030 delivered a fundamentally new architecture (KernelRuntime, pack dispatch, PolicyEngine, EvidenceStore, scope intersection) but Starlight docs still describe LumenFlow as a delivery methodology. This WU creates the foundation: rewrite introduction.mdx and create 5 new concept pages. Update sidebar.'
acceptance:
  - introduction.mdx reframes LumenFlow as a runtime kernel with pluggable domain packs
  - New kernel.mdx concept page explains KernelRuntime, ToolHost, pack dispatch, 4 guarantees
  - New packs.mdx concept page explains pack system, software-delivery as pack 1, manifest
  - New evidence.mdx concept page explains EvidenceStore, receipts, audit trail
  - New policy-engine.mdx concept page explains PolicyEngine, deny-wins, triggers
  - New scope-intersection.mdx concept page explains 4-level scope model with examples
  - Sidebar updated in astro.config.mjs to include all new concept pages
  - pnpm docs:validate passes with zero errors
