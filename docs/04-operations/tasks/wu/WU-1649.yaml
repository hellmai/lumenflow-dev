description: Mechanically decompose packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-claim.ts into focused modules for validation, worktree-mode flow, branch-only flow, and state-update helpers while preserving behavior.
acceptance:
  - wu-claim.ts is reduced to orchestration and delegates to extracted mode/validation modules.
  - Worktree and branch-pr claim semantics remain unchanged.
  - State/backlog updates remain backward compatible with existing lifecycle behavior.
