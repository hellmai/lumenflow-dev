description: 'Context: Recent wu:done runs showed a repeatable path where remote push succeeds but local post-push catch-up and cleanup behaviors become inconsistent, producing retry loops and branch cleanup noise. Problem: we lack targeted automated coverage for this sequence, so regressions can reappear unnoticed. Solution: add focused tests that simulate successful atomic push with local catch-up friction and verify idempotent completion semantics.'
acceptance:
  - Regression test reproduces successful remote push with local catch-up friction and verifies wu:done does not report failure for the completed remote merge path.
  - Regression test covers rerun/idempotency behavior after a successful remote push.
  - Regression test verifies cleanup behavior is deterministic when local branch-delete preconditions differ from remote merge state.
  - Tests fail before fix and pass after WU-1657 implementation.
  - Full gates pass.
