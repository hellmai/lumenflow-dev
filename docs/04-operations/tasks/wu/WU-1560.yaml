description: 'Context: INIT-020 completed all 16 WUs but its YAML was not updated. Problem: INIT-020.yaml still shows status in_progress with 14/15 phases as pending. WU-1534 has misleading notes saying no implementation work when the code was actually hardened. Solution: Update INIT-020 YAML status and phases, correct WU-1534 notes.'
acceptance:
  - INIT-020.yaml status is done with all phase statuses set to done
  - WU-1534 notes accurately describe the hardening work performed
