description: 'Context: wu:done runs spec:linter in worktree which fails when CLI dist is missing.
  Problem: WU-1038 fixed gates fallback but spec:linter still uses worktree CLI. Solution: Make
  spec:linter fallback to main CLI dist like gates.'
acceptance:
  - spec:linter runs in worktree without CLI dist
