description: 'Context: WU-1408 added auto-scaffolding of safe-git and pre-commit to lumenflow init. The GitHub App was developed separately and is completely out of sync with current CLI (wrong stamp paths, wrong WU types, PR-based workflow). Problem: (1) Starlight docs tell users NOT to install Husky/safe-git when init now handles this automatically, (2) GitHub App references point to non-existent/outdated functionality that would not work with current LumenFlow. Solution: (1) Update quickstart.mdx, existing-projects.mdx, solo-workflow.mdx for auto-scaffolding reality, (2) Remove all GitHub App references from lumenflow.dev, (3) Delete apps/github-app/ directory, (4) Update internal docs to CLI-only distribution model.'
acceptance:
  - quickstart.mdx no longer says 'do not install Husky, copy safe-git'
  - github-app.mdx deleted from apps/docs/
  - No GitHub App references in Starlight docs (astro.config, index, faq, guides)
  - apps/github-app/ directory deleted
  - Internal product docs updated to CLI-only distribution (product-lines.md, DISTRIBUTION.md)
  - existing-projects.mdx and solo-workflow.mdx manual husky instructions removed or updated
