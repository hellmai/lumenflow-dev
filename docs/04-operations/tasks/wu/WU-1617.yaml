description: 'Context: wu:spawn was kept as a deprecated alias after wu:brief introduction. Problem: deprecation adds ambiguity and extra maintenance for a command with minimal real usage. Solution: remove wu:spawn command/tooling surface, keep explicit wu:brief for generation and wu:delegate for lineage side effects, and update internal + Starlight docs accordingly.'
acceptance:
  - wu:spawn command is removed from CLI scripts/manifest and invoking it is no longer part of supported lifecycle.
  - MCP/public command surfaces expose wu:brief and wu:delegate without wu:spawn alias.
  - Internal and Starlight documentation no longer instruct users to use wu:spawn for delegation/prompt generation.
