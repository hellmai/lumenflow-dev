description: Several bin entry scripts in @lumenflow/cli are missing the shebang line (init.js,
  doctor.js, commands.js, docs-sync.js, sync-templates.js). This causes npx execution to fail
  because the OS tries to interpret JavaScript as bash. The Medium launch article tells users to run
  npx lumenflow init which hits this bug.
acceptance:
  - All bin entry scripts in package.json have shebang in dist output
  - npx -p @lumenflow/cli lumenflow init works in a fresh directory
  - Build pipeline ensures shebangs are added to all bin scripts going forward
