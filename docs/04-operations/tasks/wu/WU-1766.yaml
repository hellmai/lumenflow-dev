description: "wu:create --cloud has a cloud-mode bypass that skips ensureOnMain(), allowing it to work from agent branches (claude/*, codex/*). wu:claim --cloud does NOT have this bypass — it calls ensureOnMain() before the cloud check, causing it to fail on non-main branches. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem in cloud sessions: can't claim a WU (needed to edit files), can't edit files (hooks require a claimed WU)."
acceptance:
  - wu:claim --cloud bypasses ensureOnMain like wu:create --cloud does
  - wu:claim --cloud works from claude/* and codex/* branches
  - Test covering wu:claim cloud mode from non-main branch
