notes: Track B3 from enterprise hardening initiative. Split from original WU-1535 per
  wu-sizing-guide.md (Oversized -> MUST Split). Complex - use checkpoint-resume with checkpoints per
  rule. TODO justification - pre-existing TODO comment in eslint.config.mjs line 51 (not introduced
  by this WU).

description: 'Context: TypeScript lint rules (no-explicit-any, no-floating-promises, no-unused-vars)
  are disabled for CLI and core. Problem: disabled rules allow type erosion and unhandled promise
  rejections. Solution: re-enable rules one at a time with checkpoint-resume, fix violations per
  rule.'
acceptance:
  - no-explicit-any, no-floating-promises, and no-unused-vars rules are re-enabled in
    eslint.config.mjs.
  - All violations are resolved with proper types, .catch() handlers, or removal of dead code.
  - pnpm lint passes with all three rules active.
