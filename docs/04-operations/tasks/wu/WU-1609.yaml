tests:
  manual:
    - Run wu:create and wu:claim on main/master with CI env signal and verify no cloud-path activation or direct-main writes.
    - Run wu:create/wu:claim on non-main branch with explicit cloud and env-signal cloud and verify cloud behavior unchanged.

description: 'Context: env-signal auto-detection can activate cloud mode on main/master in wu:create and wu:claim, causing direct-main cloud paths and pre-commit failures. Problem: auto-detected cloud should never activate on protected main/master, and explicit cloud activation on main/master should fail fast with clear guidance. Solution: add shared branch-aware guard for effective cloud activation and wire into wu:create and wu:claim with source-aware behavior, preserving non-main cloud behavior.'
acceptance:
  - Env-signal auto-detected cloud on main/master is suppressed and commands remain in non-cloud paths.
  - Explicit cloud activation (--cloud or LUMENFLOW_CLOUD=1) on main/master fails fast with clear error.
  - Non-main branches retain existing cloud behavior for both explicit and auto-detected sources.
  - wu:create and wu:claim command-level tests prove no cloud path entry on main/master from env-signal detection.
  - No command attempts direct main writes in this scenario.
