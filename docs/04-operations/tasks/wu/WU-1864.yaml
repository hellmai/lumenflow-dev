    - Verify fuzz suite runs in CI within reasonable time (<30s)
    - Verify discovered edge cases are documented in code comments

notes: 'This is a security-critical test WU. The glob heuristic gates tool authorization — if it returns a false positive, tools execute outside their declared scope. fast-check is the standard property-based testing lib for TS. Reference: use micromatch.isMatch as ground truth oracle.'

description: 'W12: The patternContains() glob heuristic in scope intersection uses string-based pattern matching to determine if one glob contains another. Negation patterns, brace expansion, and edge cases (e.g., **/foo vs foo/**, overlapping character classes) are unproven. A malformed scope pattern could cause false containment, leading to unauthorized tool execution or false denials. Add property-based fuzz tests using fast-check to verify the heuristic against a reference implementation (micromatch) across adversarial inputs.'
acceptance:
  - Property-based tests verify patternContains against micromatch reference for 10,000+ random patterns
  - Negation patterns (!foo) handled correctly or explicitly rejected
  - Brace expansion ({a,b}) handled correctly or explicitly rejected
  - 'Edge cases documented: what patternContains guarantees vs what it approximates'
  - Any discovered bugs in glob heuristic fixed with regression tests
  - All kernel tests pass
