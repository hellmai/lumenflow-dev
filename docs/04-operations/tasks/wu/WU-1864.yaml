title: Scope intersection property-based fuzz testing for patternContains glob heuristic
lane: 'Framework: Core Lifecycle'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P2
created: 2026-02-18

  manual:
    - Verify fuzz suite runs in CI within reasonable time (<30s)
    - Verify discovered edge cases are documented in code comments

notes: 'This is a security-critical test WU. The glob heuristic gates tool authorization — if it
  returns a false positive, tools execute outside their declared scope. fast-check is the standard
  property-based testing lib for TS. Reference: use micromatch.isMatch as ground truth oracle.'

description: 'W12: The patternContains() glob heuristic in scope intersection uses string-based
  pattern matching to determine if one glob contains another. Negation patterns, brace expansion,
  and edge cases (e.g., **/foo vs foo/**, overlapping character classes) are unproven. A malformed
  scope pattern could cause false containment, leading to unauthorized tool execution or false
  denials. Add property-based fuzz tests using fast-check to verify the heuristic against a
  reference implementation (micromatch) across adversarial inputs.'
acceptance:
  - Property-based tests verify patternContains against micromatch reference for 10,000+ random
    patterns
  - Negation patterns (!foo) handled correctly or explicitly rejected
  - Brace expansion ({a,b}) handled correctly or explicitly rejected
  - 'Edge cases documented: what patternContains guarantees vs what it approximates'
  - Any discovered bugs in glob heuristic fixed with regression tests
  - All kernel tests pass
