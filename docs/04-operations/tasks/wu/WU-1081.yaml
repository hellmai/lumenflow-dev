description: WU-1077 fixed release.ts internals but left the prerelease npm script in package.json
  which runs changeset pre enter on main. Also micro-worktree push in @lumenflow/core doesn't set
  LUMENFLOW_FORCE.
acceptance:
  - Remove prerelease npm script from package.json
  - Add LUMENFLOW_FORCE to micro-worktree push in packages/@lumenflow/core/src/micro-worktree.ts
  - pnpm release creates no local changes on main
