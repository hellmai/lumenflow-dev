description: >-
  Error messages in public packages reference internal docs/04-operations/ paths that only exist in
  hellmai/os. Consumer repos get confusing See: references to files that do not exist. These should
  point to lumenflow.dev public URLs instead.


  9 error messages affected across wu-done.ts, wu-spawn.ts, backlog-sync-validator.ts,
  dependency-guard.ts, orchestration-rules.ts, wu-done-preflight.ts.


  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. Find all See: references containing docs/04-operations in packages/@lumenflow

  2. Map each internal path to equivalent lumenflow.dev URL

  3. Replace hardcoded paths with lumenflow.dev URLs

  4. Ensure URLs are valid and point to correct content
acceptance:
  - No error messages reference docs/04-operations paths
  - 'All See: references point to lumenflow.dev URLs'
  - URLs resolve to valid documentation pages
