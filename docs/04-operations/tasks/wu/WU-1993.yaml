description: Fix failing workspace connector tests by making fetch mocks deterministic across health diagnostics and create-workspace requests, preventing mock consumption races and flaky assertions.
acceptance:
  - Workspace connector test suite passes reliably in isolated runs
  - Gates no longer fail due to workspace create/create-existing test cases
  - Create-workspace AC tests assert both created and existing flows
