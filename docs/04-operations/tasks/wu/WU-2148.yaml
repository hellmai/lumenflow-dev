description: Add _signals payload to MCP tool responses when pending signals exist. Time-based throttle (max once per 5s per process). Trigger local read receipt. Optional remote ack with fail-open.
acceptance:
  - _signals field present in tool response when signals pending
  - Throttle prevents excessive signal checks
  - Read receipts appended after surfacing
  - Enrichment errors never break tool responses
  - pnpm gates passes
