description: wu:claim writes absolute paths like /home/USER/... into worktree_path in WU YAML. These
  are committed to git and visible in open source repos. worktree_path should be relative and
  resolved at runtime, and done WUs should have worktree_path stripped entirely.
acceptance:
  - wu:claim writes relative worktree_path (e.g. worktrees/framework-cli-wu-commands-wu-2239)
  - wu:done strips worktree_path from completed WU YAML
  - Batch migration strips or relativizes worktree_path from all existing done WUs
  - No absolute home paths remain in any tracked YAML file
