description: Replace the live-main merge/push block in executeWorktreeCompletion with
  withAtomicMerge so worktree-mode wu:done no longer modifies main during the dangerous merge+push
  window. Preserve existing preflight checks and completion semantics.
acceptance:
  - wu-done-worktree uses withAtomicMerge for worktree-mode lane merge/push
  - legacy preMainMergeSha and main-rollback merge-failure path are removed from worktree-mode flow
  - existing completion semantics and preflight checks remain intact
