description: Fresh worktree claims can emit noisy pnpm bin-link ENOENT warnings when workspace bin targets rely on build artifacts absent in newly created worktrees. Make setup deterministic and quiet without reducing safety.
acceptance:
  - wu:claim default setup no longer emits known bin-link ENOENT warnings in fresh worktrees
  - worktree setup remains deterministic and preserves fallback behavior on install failures
  - unit tests cover warning-prevention setup path and fallback safety
