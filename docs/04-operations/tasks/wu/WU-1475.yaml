description: 'Context: initiative:add-wu updates initiative.wus by reading and writing initiative
  YAML through strict schema helpers. Problem: unknown fields like related_plan are dropped during
  write, breaking plan traceability. Solution: make initiative:add-wu preserve non-schema fields
  when updating wus, and add regression tests.'
acceptance:
  - Adding WUs to an initiative preserves existing related_plan field in initiative YAML.
  - initiative:add-wu remains idempotent and still updates both WU.initiative and initiative.wus
    arrays.
  - Regression tests fail before fix and pass after fix for related_plan preservation.
