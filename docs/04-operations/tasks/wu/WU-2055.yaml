description: Release publish currently leaves generated CLI bundled-pack files under
  packages/@lumenflow/cli/packs as untracked artifacts. Make packaging self-cleaning and enforce
  release clean-tree guarantees.
acceptance:
  - Running npm publish flow for @lumenflow/cli does not leave generated bundled-pack artifacts in
    repo
  - release command fails if working tree is dirty after publish
