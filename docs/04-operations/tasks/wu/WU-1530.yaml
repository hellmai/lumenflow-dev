title: Single-pass wu:create validation and mandatory --help rule

    - Run pnpm wu:create with intentionally wrong fields and verify all errors appear in a single
      output

notes: Root cause identified via Codex audit + manual transcript analysis. The validateCreateSpec
  early return at ~line 531 is the main code culprit. Spec lint runs inside createWUYamlInWorktree
  (after worktree creation) but could be extracted to run earlier with in-memory YAML. The
  --validate flag exists but is dead code - consider activating it as part of this fix.

description: 'Context: Agents consistently fail wu:create 4-6 times before success because (1)
  validation is fail-fast across 3 sequential stages so errors trickle out one-at-a-time, (2) no
  --help rule exists in CLAUDE.md so agents guess flags, and (3) quick-ref-commands.md has wrong
  examples (wu:edit --field, pnpm lumenflow commands). Problem: Each wu:create attempt takes ~10s
  including micro-worktree setup, so 6 attempts wastes a minute and floods context. Solution:
  Collect all validation errors in a single pass (remove early returns in validateCreateSpec, run
  lint before worktree creation), add mandatory --help rule to both CLAUDE.md files, and fix
  incorrect quick-ref examples.'
acceptance:
  - validateCreateSpec collects all field, placeholder, schema, completeness, and path errors before
    returning
  - Spec lint validation runs before micro-worktree creation using in-memory YAML check
  - Both CLAUDE.md and .claude/CLAUDE.md include mandatory --help rule
  - 'quick-ref-commands.md: wu:edit --field replaced with correct flags'
  - 'quick-ref-commands.md: pnpm lumenflow commands replaced with working command'
  - 'quick-ref-commands.md: Complete reference softened, workflow sequence includes --help step'
