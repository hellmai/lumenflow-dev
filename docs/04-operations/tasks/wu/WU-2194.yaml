description: "wu:claim, wu:edit (ready path), and wu:delete all call ensureMainUpToDate() as a
  pre-flight check before entering withMicroWorktree/pushOnly mode. This is redundant because: (1)
  pushOnly mode (wu:claim) bases from origin/main, not local main, (2) standard withMicroWorktree
  (wu:edit, wu:delete) auto-syncs local main via ff-merge internally. initiative:edit already
  removed this check in WU-1497 with the comment 'withMicroWorktree already handles origin sync'.
  The pre-flight check creates serial friction for multi-agent orchestration — each wu:claim pushes
  to origin, putting the next claim's local main out of sync, requiring manual git pull between
  claims."
acceptance:
  - ensureMainUpToDate pre-flight call removed from wu-claim.ts
  - ensureMainUpToDate pre-flight call removed from wu-edit.ts ready-WU path
  - ensureMainUpToDate pre-flight call removed from wu-delete.ts (single and batch)
  - Regression tests assert ensureMainUpToDate is NOT called (following initiative-edit.test.ts
    pattern from WU-1497)
  - wu:done retains both ensureMainUpToDate and ensureMainNotBehindOrigin checks (justified — real
    merge)
  - All existing tests pass
