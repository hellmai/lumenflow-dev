description: >-
  The @lumenflow/cli README only documents ~30 commands but the package exposes ~70+ bin entries.
  Critical commands like validate-backlog-sync, lumenflow-upgrade, wu-status are undocumented.
  Agents cannot discover these commands exist.


  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - FILE SWEEP REQUIRED:

  1. Extract all bin entries: cat packages/@lumenflow/cli/package.json | grep -A200 bin | grep -oP
  '"[a-z-]+":' | tr -d '":' | sort > /tmp/all-commands.txt

  2. Extract documented commands from README.md

  3. Diff to find undocumented commands

  4. For each missing command, run npx <command> --help to get description

  5. Add to appropriate section in README with description and usage example

  6. Verify final count matches bin entries count
acceptance:
  - All bin entries in package.json are documented in README.md
  - Each command has description and example usage
  - Validation commands section added (validate-backlog-sync, validate-agent-skills, etc)
  - Upgrade commands section added (lumenflow-upgrade)
  - File sweep diff shows zero undocumented commands
