description: Add explicit guidance that agents should never 'quick fix' issues on main, even helpful
  ones like format fixes. Current docs focus on worktree discipline after WU claim, but don't cover
  the scenario where an agent on main sees a problem and tries to help directly.
acceptance:
  - constraints.md includes 'Never Quick Fix on Main' section
  - first-wu-mistakes.md includes this as a numbered mistake
  - 'Guidance clearly states: if on main and want to change something, create a WU first'
