description: After template extraction, mechanically extract scaffolding/file-utils/detection
  helpers from init.ts into dedicated modules while preserving behavior and command interface.
acceptance:
  - Scaffolding and detection helper functions are moved to focused modules and imported by init.ts
    orchestrator.
  - init.ts remains behaviorally equivalent for client detection and scaffold generation.
  - No API/CLI contract changes are introduced.
