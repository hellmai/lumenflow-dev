notes: Single-session refactor across 2 guard files plus 3 baseline files; repeated mechanical
  pattern from WU-2130. Sized as shallow multi-file exception per wu-sizing-guide.md §1.2.

description: 'WU-2130 fixed baseline self-healing for type-safety-guard, but the same
  persistence-before-check bug remains in error-pattern-guard and path-literal-guard (file-extension
  + env-var ratchets). A failing run can still overwrite baseline files and pass on the next run.
  Apply the same ordering hardening pattern across remaining ratchet guards: compare first, fail
  without writes, then persist only on allowed paths (first-run, improvement, or explicit opt-in).'
acceptance:
  - error-pattern-guard compares currentCount vs savedBaseline before any baseline write
  - path-literal file-extension and env-var ratchets compare before writes and never mutate baseline
    on regression failures
  - baseline updates are explicit/controlled (first-run, improvement, or explicit opt-in) and not
    unconditional side-effects
  - tests verify non-mutation behavior and ordering guarantees for all hardened ratchets
  - targeted core guard tests pass for error-pattern and path-literal suites
