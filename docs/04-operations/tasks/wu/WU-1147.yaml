description: 'Context: wu:done regenerates backlog.md via generateBacklog(), which currently reads
  only WUStateStore (wu-events.jsonl). Problem: the store can be incomplete versus YAML specs,
  causing backlog generation to drop WUs (e.g., 141 YAML files vs 67 in the store). Solution: scan
  docs/04-operations/tasks/wu/*.yaml during backlog generation, merge missing WUs into the set,
  prefer state store fields when present, and fall back to YAML fields for missing WUs.'
acceptance:
  - generateBacklog reads WU YAML specs from docs/04-operations/tasks/wu and merges IDs missing from
    WUStateStore
  - Backlog output includes every WU YAML file even when missing from wu-events.jsonl
  - When a WU exists in both sources, state store values remain authoritative
  - YAML-only WUs use status/title/lane from YAML without duplicates
  - Unit tests cover YAML-only WUs and mixed store+YAML scenarios
  - pnpm gates passes
