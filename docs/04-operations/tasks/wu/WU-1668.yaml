  manual:
    - Run pnpm exec vitest run packages/@lumenflow/core/src/schemas/__tests__/schema-parity.test.ts
      and confirm count assertions pass.

notes: Discovered while executing WU-1667; treated as pre-existing gate failure on main and tracked
  as fix WU for skip-gates audit.

description: 'Context: gates currently fail on main due to stale expected lifecycle schema counts in
  packages/@lumenflow/core/src/schemas/__tests__/schema-parity.test.ts (expects 16, actual 17).
  Problem: unrelated WUs are blocked by this pre-existing parity assertion drift. Solution: update
  expected registry totals/count assertions to match current lifecycle schema registry and restore
  green gates.'
acceptance:
  - schema-parity lifecycle registry count assertion reflects current lifecycleCommandSchemas
    cardinality.
  - total expected schema count assertion is updated consistently.
  - Targeted schema parity tests pass on main and in worktrees.
