description: 'Context: Public docs at lumenflow.dev/reference/cli advertise 107 commands but only
  ~52 are wired in package.json. Problem: Users and agents cannot run documented commands like
  wu:delete, wu:unlock-lane, lumenflow:upgrade. The code exists in dist but is not accessible via
  pnpm. Solution: Wire missing user-facing commands to package.json scripts.'
