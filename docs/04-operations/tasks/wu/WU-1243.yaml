description: 'Context: Public docs at lumenflow.dev/reference/cli advertise 107 commands but only ~52 are wired in package.json. Problem: Users and agents cannot run documented commands like wu:delete, wu:unlock-lane, lumenflow:upgrade. The code exists in dist but is not accessible via pnpm. Solution: Wire missing user-facing commands to package.json scripts.'
acceptance:
  - wu:delete wired and works via pnpm wu:delete
  - wu:unlock-lane wired and works
  - lumenflow:upgrade wired and works
  - backlog:prune wired and works
  - deps:add and deps:remove wired and work
  - state:bootstrap wired and works
  - lane:suggest wired and works
  - init:plan wired and works
