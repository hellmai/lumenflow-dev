description: Update documentation to clearly state LumenFlow works with ANY AI coding assistant (friction-free for all), while highlighting enhanced integrations for specific vendors (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline). Current docs imply a closed list of supported vendors rather than universal compatibility with optional enhancements.
acceptance:
  - introduction.mdx states LumenFlow works with any AI that can read markdown
  - vendor-support.md reframed as Vendor Integrations with universal-first message
  - ai-agents.mdx includes friction-free positioning statement
  - AGENTS.md header clarifies universal compatibility
  - Starlight site has vendor integrations page synced from internal docs
