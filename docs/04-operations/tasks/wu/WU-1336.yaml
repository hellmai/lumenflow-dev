description: Refactor retry exhaustion detection/formatting into core micro-worktree abstraction so CLI commands do not duplicate helpers. Use p-retry and simple-git via existing git-operations. Expose a typed error or helper from core and update initiative add/remove to use it.
acceptance:
  - micro-worktree exposes a single retry-exhaustion helper or error type
  - initiative:add-wu and initiative:remove-wu use the shared helper (no duplicate helpers in CLI files)
  - Retry exhaustion messaging still includes actionable next steps
  - Tests updated to cover shared helper
