description: 'Context: WU-1676 completion repeatedly fails at wu:done test gate with Vitest
  worker-fork teardown timeout in packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/wu-done.test.ts while all
  relevant WU tests pass. Problem: unrelated WUs touching CLI are blocked by intermittent full
  changed-suite worker failures. Solution: make the affected test/gate runner deterministic under
  changed-test execution and remove this flake from completion flow.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done no longer fails due to worker-fork timeout in
    packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/wu-done.test.ts under changed-test gate runs
  - A reproducible local command is documented and passes in at least two consecutive runs
  - Targeted and relevant gate tests pass
