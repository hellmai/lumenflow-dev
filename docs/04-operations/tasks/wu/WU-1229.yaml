description: "Multiple issues in micro-worktree operations: (1) wu:block fails if status.md missing '## Blocked' section, (2) auto-repair push blocked by pre-push hook (missing LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL env), (3) orphaned temp worktrees not cleaned up on failure."
acceptance:
  - wu:block handles missing status.md sections gracefully
  - Micro-worktree operations set LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL to bypass pre-push hook
  - Failed operations clean up temp worktrees before exit
