description: "Context: Haven 2.8.0 testing showed agent ignored brief CLAUDE.md template. Problem: Template is 15 lines, just says 'see LUMENFLOW.md', agent skipped it and wrote YAML manually. Solution: Expand template to include CLI command table directly, warn against manual YAML writes, prominently mention initiatives."
acceptance:
  - CLAUDE.md template includes CLI commands table inline
  - Template has WARNING block about not writing YAML manually
  - Template mentions initiatives before WU workflow
