description: "Refactor gates to be fully language-agnostic and config-driven. Instead of hardcoding
  language presets (node, python, go, rust) in the GitHub Action, gates should read commands from
  .lumenflow.config.yaml. Users define their own format, lint, test commands. Optional presets
  expand to sensible defaults but are not hardcoded logic. This aligns with LumenFlow's
  vendor-agnostic, frictionless philosophy. Uses well-known libraries: yaml for parsing, zod for
  validation, @actions/toolkit for the TypeScript GitHub Action."
acceptance:
  - gates section added to .lumenflow.config.yaml schema with setup, format, lint, test, coverage
    fields
  - Each gate field accepts a string (shell command) or object with command and options
  - Gates runner in CLI reads commands from config instead of hardcoding eslint/vitest/prettier
  - GitHub Action converted from composite YAML to TypeScript action using @actions/toolkit
  - GitHub Action reads .lumenflow.config.yaml and executes configured commands via @actions/exec
  - Preset field in config expands to default commands (lumenflow init --preset dotnet populates
    defaults)
  - Existing hardcoded presets removed from action.yml (node, python, go, rust sections deleted)
  - Skip flags (skip-format, skip-lint, skip-test) still work by skipping configured command
  - 'Backwards compatible: action falls back to auto-detect if no gates config present'
  - Documentation updated with examples for .NET, Python, Go, Rust, and custom configurations
  - 'Starlight docs updated: gates.mdx rewritten for config-driven approach'
  - 'Starlight docs updated: config.mdx includes gates schema reference'
  - 'Starlight docs updated: quickstart.mdx shows language-agnostic setup'
  - 'Internal docs updated: DISTRIBUTION.md preset table replaced with config examples'
  - 'Internal docs updated: lumenflow-complete.md gates section revised'
