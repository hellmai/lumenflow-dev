description: 'Context: Humans and agents miss the correct agent-safe path. Quickstart mixes human
  and agent steps, omits initiatives, and includes manual edits. Problem: Agents start in the wrong
  place and go off-rails. Solution: Add a dedicated Agent Start Here page, route
  Quickstart/Home/Sidebar to it, and make Quickstart agent-safe (initiative-first, no manual script
  edits, clarify AGENTS.md ownership, docs structure note).'
acceptance:
  - Add Agent Start Here page with strict command-only runbook (new vs existing project forks).
  - Agent Start Here includes initiative-first workflow, session-0 stop point, and handoff prompt.
  - Quickstart links to Agent Start Here and removes manual package.json script step.
  - Quickstart adds initiative step before WU creation and clarifies AGENTS.md is user-owned.
  - Sidebar and homepage include Agent Start Here link.
