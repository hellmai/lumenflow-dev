description: Mechanically decompose packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/gates.ts into focused modules for gate runners, plan resolution, and utility helpers while preserving gate behavior.
acceptance:
  - run* gate functions are extracted into dedicated modules and imported by gates.ts orchestrator.
  - Gate planning/resolution logic is moved without changing lint/test/typecheck/spec-linter behavior.
  - CLI gates interface and output remain backward compatible.
