description: Extract a stable helper surface from micro-worktree into micro-worktree-shared.ts so atomic merge can reuse temp branch/worktree/push-retry primitives without tight coupling. This WU is a pure move/re-export with no behavior change.
acceptance:
  - micro-worktree-shared.ts contains the extracted temp-branch/worktree and push-retry helpers with stable exports
  - micro-worktree.ts imports/re-exports the shared helpers without behavior changes
  - core callers remain backward compatible via unchanged public exports
