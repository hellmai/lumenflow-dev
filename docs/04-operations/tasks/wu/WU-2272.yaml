description: Publishing a pack to the registry fails with 'blob already exists' when a blob path has
  been used before (e.g. failed upload, re-publish). Add allowOverwrite:true to both put() calls in
  pack-registry-store-vercel-blob.ts.
acceptance:
  - put() calls in VercelBlobPackBlobStore and VercelBlobPackRegistryStore include
    allowOverwrite:true
  - Re-publishing a pack version to registry.lumenflow.dev succeeds
