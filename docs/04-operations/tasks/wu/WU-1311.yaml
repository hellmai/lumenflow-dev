description: Finish CLI path centralization by replacing remaining hardcoded docs/04-operations
  paths with WU_PATHS/getResolvedPaths across wu-* commands and diagnostics. Add state-doctor
  warnings for missing configured paths and ensure CLI respects config overrides. Depends on WU-1310
  core path defaults.
acceptance:
  - No hardcoded docs/04-operations paths remain in CLI commands (use WU_PATHS/getResolvedPaths)
  - state-doctor warns when configured paths are missing
  - Config overrides are respected across wu-* commands and diagnostics
  - Unit tests cover CLI path usage and warnings
