description: 'Context: runtime migration now covers the initial task/tool execution slice, but
  shell-out pathways remain across legacy MCP tool domains. Problem: Phase 4 lacks an explicit,
  auditable timeline that states what stays shell-out temporarily, what migrates next, and what
  objective criteria mark deprecation completion. Solution: publish a deprecation roadmap artifact
  under initiative governance that captures inventory, wave order, target milestones, and measurable
  exit criteria for reducing runCliCommand usage.'
acceptance:
  - INIT-030 includes a formal deprecation timeline section listing remaining shell-out domains and
    migration waves.
  - 'Timeline defines measurable checkpoints (for example: shell-out call-site budget targets,
    parity readiness gates, and per-wave completion criteria).'
  - Phase 4 status/notes are updated to reference the roadmap artifact so closure is auditable.
