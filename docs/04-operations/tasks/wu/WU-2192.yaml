description: config:set currently validates all pack-scoped writes with LumenFlowConfigSchema, which
  hardcodes software-delivery behavior. Implement pack-aware validation that resolves the owning
  pack and enforces its declared config_schema contract for write-path validation.
acceptance:
  - config:set routes pack-scoped writes to schema validation for the owning pack instead of always
    using LumenFlowConfigSchema
  - Unknown/invalid keys for a pack are rejected according to that pack schema
  - Unit tests cover schema-based validation for software_delivery and at least one non-SD pack
    fixture
