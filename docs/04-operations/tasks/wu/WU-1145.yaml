description: When wu:done updates metadata (backlog.md, status.md), it uses a stale snapshot from worktree claim time. Any changes made to backlog.md on main after the worktree diverged are lost. This caused loss of 76 WU entries during WU-1141 completion.
acceptance:
  - wu:done merges backlog changes instead of overwriting
  - Concurrent additions to Done section are preserved
  - Concurrent additions to Ready section are preserved
  - Add test for concurrent backlog modification scenario
