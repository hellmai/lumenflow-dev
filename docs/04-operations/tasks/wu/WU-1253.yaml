description: 'Context: WU-1210 changed implementation but didnt update corresponding test. Test
  failed on main for days. WU-1239 fixed by updating test expectations but this is a TDD violation.
  Problem: Gates dont distinguish pre-existing failures vs NEW failures you caused. Agents have TDD
  guidance but no explicit ratchet rule. Solution: (1) Test baseline file tracking known failures,
  (2) Gate modification to block NEW failures only, (3) Skip-gates debt tracking, (4) Agent guidance
  in wu:spawn and constraints.md.'
acceptance:
  - test-baseline.json file format defined
  - pnpm gates compares results against baseline
  - NEW test failures block gate, pre-existing allowed with warning
  - Baseline auto-updates when tests fixed (ratchet forward)
  - wu:spawn TDD directive includes Test Ratchet Rule
  - constraints.md has new constraint about test ratchet
  - Agent onboarding doc test-ratchet.md created
