description: 'Context: Build and lint guardrails are broadly disabled across config layers. Problem: weak defaults allow unsafe and low-quality code paths to enter production artifacts. Solution: ratchet TypeScript and ESLint guardrails back on with explicit allowlists and staged enforcement.'
acceptance:
  - Build config enforces strict checking and noEmitOnError for production compilation.
  - Per-package tsconfig files align with stricter baseline or explicit temporary exceptions.
  - Security and type-safety lint rules are re-enabled with targeted suppressions only.
