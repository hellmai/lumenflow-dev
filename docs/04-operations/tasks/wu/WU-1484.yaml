title: Complete CLI shared-validator wiring for schema-backed commands
lane: 'Framework: CLI'
type: refactor
status: done
priority: P2
created: 2026-02-06
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/shared-validators.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/initiative-edit.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-validate.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-proto.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Run targeted CLI commands with invalid flags/values and confirm consistent schema-derived
      errors.
    - Run pnpm --filter @lumenflow/cli test and verify validator wiring tests pass.
  unit:
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/initiative-edit.test.ts
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/wu-validate.test.ts
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/wu-proto.test.ts

  split follow-up WU if file count or tool calls exceed thresholds.'

description: 'Context: @lumenflow/core exports shared argument validators for schema-backed
  commands, but CLI entrypoints still have uneven adoption and custom argument handling. Problem:
  this leaves CLI/MCP parity vulnerable to drift even when schemas exist. Solution: wire targeted
  CLI command families to shared validators and add regression tests proving invalid/valid argument
  behavior remains consistent.'
acceptance:
  - CLI entrypoints for targeted schema-backed command families call shared validators from
    packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/shared-validators.ts (or direct core validator exports) instead of
    bespoke parsing.
  - Validation behavior is consistent with shared schemas for required fields, enum values, and
    optional flags.
  - Unit tests cover at least one positive and one negative validation case per wired command family.
  - Parity-focused MCP WUs can rely on shared validator behavior without re-implementing flag
    validation rules in tools.ts.
