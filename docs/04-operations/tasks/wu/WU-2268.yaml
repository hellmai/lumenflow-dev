description: 'Context: The sidekick pack was scaffolded for npm publish (WU-2267) but the
  software-delivery pack still lacks package.json and tsconfig.json. Problem: software-delivery pack
  cannot be published to npm or the pack registry. Solution: Add package.json, tsconfig.json, build,
  release, and publish to registry.lumenflow.dev.'
acceptance:
  - software-delivery pack builds cleanly
  - pnpm release includes software-delivery in version bump
  - software-delivery pack published to registry.lumenflow.dev
