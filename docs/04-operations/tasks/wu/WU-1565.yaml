title: Guard lifecycle checks against untracked done-stamp masking

tests:
  manual:
    - Run pnpm state:doctor --json and pnpm wu:repair --all --check in a repo with untracked done
      stamps; verify missing-stamp issues are reported instead of false clean

notes: Added index-aware stamp visibility guard for lifecycle integrity checks. Untracked local
  .done artifacts are excluded from state:doctor/wu:repair stamp presence logic; if git visibility
  is unavailable, behavior falls back safely.

description: 'Context: state:doctor and wu:repair can report false-clean lifecycle integrity when
  local untracked .lumenflow/stamps/WU-*.done files exist (often hidden by
  status.showUntrackedFiles=no). Problem: untracked local artifacts mask missing tracked stamps on
  main, allowing polluted closeout and misleading diagnostics. Solution: make stamp detection
  index-aware for lifecycle integrity checks and add regression tests covering untracked-stamp
  masking.'
acceptance:
  - state:doctor and wu:repair treat untracked local stamp files as missing for lifecycle integrity
    checks
  - With untracked local stamp and YAML status done, diagnostics report missing-stamp inconsistency
    (no false-clean)
  - Regression tests cover untracked stamp masking and pass
