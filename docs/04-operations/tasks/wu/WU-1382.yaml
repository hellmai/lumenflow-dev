description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 testing showed agents edit managed files because templates lack warnings. Problem: CLAUDE.md is too brief, config files have no managed indicator. Solution: (1) Expand CLAUDE.md template with inline CLI commands table and warning not to edit YAML manually, (2) Add LUMENFLOW MANAGED FILE header to config and lane-inference templates.'
acceptance:
  - CLAUDE.md template includes CLI commands table inline
  - CLAUDE.md template has warning about manual YAML editing
  - Config yaml template has managed file header block
  - Lane-inference yaml template has managed file header
