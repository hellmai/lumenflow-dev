notes: 'Root cause: (1) auto-cleanup modifies tracked wu-events.jsonl and creates untracked archive files after push. (2) Config cache from process start is stale after merge. Fix: re-read config after merge, gitignore archive dir, and auto-commit or skip cleanup on tracked files.'

description: 'After wu:done, main can become dirty with .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl modified and .lumenflow/archive/* created. Root cause: auto-cleanup modifies tracked wu-events.jsonl and creates untracked archive files after push completes. Config cache is also stale after merge so merged cleanup.trigger changes are not respected.'
acceptance:
  - Running wu:done leaves git status clean on main
  - No untracked .lumenflow/archive/* side effects unless explicitly requested
  - 'Regression test: wu:done with archival candidates present does not dirty main'
  - Config cache is re-read after merge so merged cleanup.trigger changes are respected
