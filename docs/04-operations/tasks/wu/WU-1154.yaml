description: Preflight test path validation can block wu:done when test paths move. Enhance validation to surface a best-effort suggested path or clearer guidance to reduce churn.
acceptance:
  - preflight error includes actionable guidance when a test path is missing
  - suggested path (if found) is included in output
  - unit test covers missing test path guidance
