description: Mechanically decompose packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-create.ts into validation,
  content generation, and readiness helper modules while preserving creation semantics.
acceptance:
  - wu-create.ts delegates to extracted validation/content/readiness helpers and remains
    orchestrator-focused.
  - WU spec/content generation and strict validation behavior remain unchanged.
  - CLI contract for wu:create remains backward compatible.
