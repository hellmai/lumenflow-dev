notes: 'Single-session override: ~10 files modified across core, cli, shims packages but all are
  mechanical search-replace of raw LUMENFLOW_X string literals to ENV_VARS.X references. Each change
  is 1-2 lines, pattern is identical across all files. No structural changes. Complexity: Low
  (uniform search-replace). Shallow multi-file exception per wu-sizing-guide.md §1.2. Note:
  git-shim.ts is in @lumenflow/shims (not core); branch-check.ts is in @lumenflow/core.'

description: 'After WU-2113 adds the ENV_VARS constant and guard, migrate all raw LUMENFLOW_ string
  usages to ENV_VARS.*. Scope: all files flagged by the path-literal-guard LUMENFLOW_ rule across
  core, cli, and shims packages (primary hits: branch-check.ts in core, git-shim.ts in shims, and
  others found by the guard). Uniform search-replace LUMENFLOW_X -> ENV_VARS.X. Verify guard reports
  zero violations after migration.'
acceptance:
  - All raw LUMENFLOW_ env var strings replaced with ENV_VARS.* references across core, cli, shims
  - path-literal-guard LUMENFLOW_ rule reports zero violations
  - pnpm test --filter=@lumenflow/core --filter=@lumenflow/cli --filter=@lumenflow/shims passes
