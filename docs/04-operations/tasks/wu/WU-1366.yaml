description: 'Consolidates WU-1224, WU-1316, WU-1355. Fixes: (1) wu:done should auto-run state:cleanup after success, (2) wu:create should aggregate required-field errors, (3) cli-entry.mjs should fallback to main CLI dist before attempting build in worktrees.'
acceptance:
  - State cleanup runs automatically after wu:done success (non-fatal)
  - Add cleanup.trigger config option (on_done | on_init | manual) with on_done default
  - Missing required fields in wu:create are reported together in a single error block
  - spec:linter runs successfully in worktrees without built CLI by falling back to main CLI dist
