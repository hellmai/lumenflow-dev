description: 'Context: After C1 codemods all dist imports to public subpaths, wildcard exports still
  exist. Problem: new dist imports can still be introduced. Solution: add no-restricted-imports lint
  rule, remove wildcard exports from all 4 packages, run full validation, verify zero dist-path
  usage repo-wide.'
acceptance:
  - no-restricted-imports lint rule blocks new dist/* imports as errors.
  - Wildcard dist and lib exports removed from core, memory, initiatives, and agent package.json
    files.
  - rg @lumenflow/.+/dist/ packages/ apps/ tools/ actions/ returns zero results.
