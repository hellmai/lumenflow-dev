description: 'Context: Validate that wu:create enforces fully specified WUs after WU-1043. Problem: users previously needed wu:edit due to placeholder specs. Solution: create a complete WU spec in a single wu:create invocation to confirm enforcement works.'
acceptance:
  - wu:create succeeds only with full spec fields
  - WU is claim-ready immediately after creation
