title: Add lifecycle regression harness for create/done/delete state consistency
lane: 'Framework: Core Lifecycle'
type: refactor
status: in_progress
priority: P2
created: 2026-02-07
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/lifecycle-regression-harness.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/lifecycle-regression-harness.test.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - 'Run `pnpm --filter @lumenflow/core build` then `pnpm --filter @lumenflow/cli exec vitest run src/__tests__/lifecycle-regression-harness.test.ts` and verify the green path passes with no Broken Event in final diagnosis.'
    - 'In the same test suite, verify the red-path case (`skipDoctorFix: true`) fails with stage-tagged error context (`stage: "doctor"`), confirming fast stage-level diagnosis.'

description: 'Context: lifecycle defects have escaped repeatedly across wu:create, wu:done,
  wu:delete, and state:doctor interactions. Problem: targeted unit tests miss cross-command
  consistency regressions. Solution: add a deterministic lifecycle regression harness that exercises
  create→claim→done/delete consistency invariants and verifies projections/state-store remain
  clean.'
acceptance:
  - Test harness reproduces end-to-end lifecycle transitions and asserts clean status/backlog/state
    projections
  - Harness asserts no Broken Event remains for deleted WUs
  - Failures point directly to violating command stage (create/claim/done/delete/doctor) for fast
    diagnosis
