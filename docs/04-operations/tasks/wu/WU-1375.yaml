description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 testing showed agent wrote .lumenflow.config.yaml manually via Write tool BEFORE running lumenflow init. Problem: Init silently skipped these files, agent never learned to use CLI. Solution: Init should detect manually-written config files and warn that CLI commands should be used instead, or suggest --merge mode.'
acceptance:
  - Init warns if .lumenflow.config.yaml exists but was not created by init
  - Warning message suggests using CLI commands instead of manual YAML
  - Warning shows how to use --merge mode for intentional customization
