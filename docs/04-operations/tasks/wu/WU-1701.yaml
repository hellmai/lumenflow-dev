description: Emergency cleanup to remove domain-specific code that was inadvertently
  included when the repo was open-sourced. This includes PII scanner types, sensitive data
  constants, compliance checker exports, and domain-specific patterns in escalation detection.
  The code does not belong in a general-purpose workflow framework.
acceptance:
  - All domain-specific constants removed
  - Barrel exports updated
  - Domain-specific test globs removed
  - Domain-specific patterns removed from escalation detection
  - Domain-specific type exports removed from index.ts
  - Domain-specific type declarations removed from types.d.ts
  - Domain-specific export entries and deps removed from package.json
  - Test files updated
