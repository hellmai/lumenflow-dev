description: Emergency cleanup to remove domain-specific code that was inadvertently included when
  the repo was open-sourced. This includes PII scanner types, sensitive data constants, compliance
  checker exports, and domain-specific patterns in escalation detection. The code does not belong in
  a general-purpose workflow framework.
acceptance:
  - All domain-specific constants removed
  - Barrel exports updated
  - Domain-specific test globs removed
  - Domain-specific patterns removed from escalation detection
  - Domain-specific type exports removed from index.ts
  - Domain-specific type declarations removed from types.d.ts
  - Domain-specific export entries and deps removed from package.json
  - Test files updated
