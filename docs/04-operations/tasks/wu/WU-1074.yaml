description: 'The npm release process currently requires manual steps: sed for version bumps,
  LUMENFLOW_FORCE commits, manual build and publish. Should have a proper release command that uses
  micro-worktree isolation like wu:create does.'
acceptance:
  - pnpm release --version X.Y.Z command exists
  - Command bumps all @lumenflow/* package versions
  - Command uses micro-worktree isolation for version commit
  - Command builds all packages
  - Command publishes to npm with proper auth
  - Command creates git tag vX.Y.Z
  - Gates pass
  - CLI reference docs updated with release command usage
  - Command reads npm auth from ~/.npmrc or NODE_AUTH_TOKEN env var
  - Error message if no npm auth found
