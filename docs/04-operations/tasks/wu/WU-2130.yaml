title: Harden UnsafeAny ratchet guard to prevent baseline self-healing on failure
lane: 'Framework: Core Lifecycle'

  manual:
    - Run pnpm test --testNamePattern=type-safety-guard with no code changes and verify no baseline
      file mutation
    - Add deliberate UnsafeAny usage and verify guard fails without rewriting baseline

description: WU-2110 introduced a ratcheting guard for UnsafeAny, but baseline persistence happens
  before regression enforcement. This allows a failing run to raise baseline state and pass on a
  follow-up run. Harden the guard so failure paths cannot mutate baseline state, and baseline
  refresh is explicit opt-in only.
acceptance:
  - Ratchet comparison runs before any baseline write operation
  - Regression failure path does not modify the baseline file
  - Baseline updates are explicit opt-in, not default side effects during normal test execution
  - Tests cover non-mutation behavior on failure and baseline refresh path
  - pnpm test --testNamePattern=type-safety-guard passes
