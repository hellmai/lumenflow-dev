    - Force a wu:done merge-failure path and verify main remains clean, then re-claim WU without
      manual git cleanup.

description: Failed wu:done completion paths can append lifecycle events locally and then roll back
  branch/worktree state, leaving main dirty and out of sync with origin. Subsequent wu:claim/wu:done
  operations get blocked by .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl drift.
acceptance:
  - When wu:done fails after metadata/event writes, local main and origin/main remain consistent for
    wu-events state (no lingering dirty main from partial complete events).
  - Recovery path (wu:recover reset/resume) does not require manual git restore/pull before claiming
    the same WU again.
  - Regression coverage reproduces the failure path and proves state remains clean/consistent after
    rollback.
