description: 'lumenflow:upgrade uses micro-worktree to update packages but push fails because: (1) lumenflow-upgrade is not in ALLOWED_WU_TOOLS in pre-push hook, so the hook runs full validation instead of early-exiting, and (2) node_modules on main is stale after the lockfile merge since pnpm install is not run before pushing.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow-upgrade is added to ALLOWED_WU_TOOLS in pre-push hook template
  - lumenflow:upgrade runs pnpm install --frozen-lockfile on main after merge and before push
  - Pre-push hook test covers lumenflow-upgrade tool value
