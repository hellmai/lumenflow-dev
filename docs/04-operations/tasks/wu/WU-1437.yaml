  failure blocked unrelated WU completion. Solution: reproduce, identify root cause, and ensure
  gates no longer fail due to initiatives timeouts.'
acceptance:
  - Root cause for gates failure identified and documented.
  - Initiatives test suite passes without timeout in orchestrate-initiative-wu1251.test.ts.
