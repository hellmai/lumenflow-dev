description: Align all agents (Windsurf, Cursor, etc.) with LumenFlow safety standards by migrating Claude-specific protections. 1) Create 'scripts/safe-git' wrapper to block 'worktree remove'. 2) Migrate 'validate-worktree-path' to Husky 'pre-commit' hook.
acceptance:
  - Manual 'git worktree remove' via safe-git wrapper is blocked or warned
  - Generic 'git commit' with absolute paths is blocked by Husky hook
  - Safety mechanisms work for non-Claude agents
