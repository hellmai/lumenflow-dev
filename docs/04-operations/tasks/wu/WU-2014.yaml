description: 'Split wu-done-worktree.ts (1777 lines) into focused modules: wu-done-merge.ts (atomic merge operations), wu-done-cleanup.ts (worktree/branch cleanup after merge), wu-done-validators.ts (pre-merge validation checks). This is the hottest code path — every WU completion flows through it.'
acceptance:
  - wu-done-worktree.ts reduced to under 500 lines
  - Each extracted module has single responsibility
  - All existing wu-done tests pass without modification
  - wu:done end-to-end workflow unchanged
