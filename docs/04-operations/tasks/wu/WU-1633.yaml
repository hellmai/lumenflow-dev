description: Fix lifecycle tooling deadlock when main is broken and fix wu:edit script path for worktrees. Ensure strict lifecycle entries can use existing dist as break-glass fallback when build fails, and route wu:edit through cli-entry for consistent worktree behavior.
acceptance:
  - wu:edit works from a claimed worktree without requiring local cli dist build
  - wu:done and wu:claim can proceed using existing dist when strict pre-build fails, with explicit warning
  - cli-entry unit tests cover fallback and strict-entry failure behavior at 100% for changed branches
