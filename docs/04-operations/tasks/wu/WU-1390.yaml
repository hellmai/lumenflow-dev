description: 'WU-1136 documented pre-compaction hook guidance but never implemented it. This WU implements: (1) mem:recover command for vendor-agnostic recovery context generation, (2) PreCompact hook that saves checkpoint and writes recovery file, (3) SessionStart hook that reads recovery file and injects context after compaction.'
acceptance:
  - mem:recover command outputs recovery context with constraints, checkpoint, and CLI ref (max 2KB)
  - PreCompact hook creates recovery file at .lumenflow/state/recovery-pending-WU-XXX.md
  - SessionStart hook (compact/resume/clear matchers) reads and displays recovery file
  - Hook templates added for lumenflow init propagation
