  Implements Claude finding #1: fail-open window after worktree deletion.


  Vendor-agnostic behavior required: shared detection logic in CLI/core, wrappers generated per
  client.

description: 'Context: validate-worktree-path currently allows Write/Edit when no worktrees exist,
  leaving main effectively unguarded after wu:done cleanup. Problem: this fail-open behavior permits
  untracked main writes outside active WUs. Solution: fail closed on main unless explicit safe
  exceptions are matched and/or an active claimed WU context permits the write.'
acceptance:
  - 'Fail-closed default on main: Write/Edit blocked when no active claim context exists, even if no
    worktrees are present'
  - 'Explicit allowlist is enforced and test-covered: docs/04-operations/tasks/wu/, .lumenflow/,
    .claude/, and plan/spec scaffold paths'
  - Branch-PR claimed_mode remains writable from main checkout and is covered by regression tests
  - Enforcement generator produces equivalent fail-closed wrappers for all supported clients; vendor
    hooks are thin wrappers over shared logic
