tests:
  manual:
    - Run lumenflow init in temp dir and verify cos:gates script exists in package.json
    - Run wu:done --help and verify --skip-cos-gates is not mentioned
    - Run lumenflow init and verify .logs/ is in .gitignore
    - Run lumenflow init and verify lane naming format is displayed
    - Run wu:create with multiple invalid fields and verify all errors shown at once

description: 'Context: lumenflow init scaffolds a new project with stubs for lint, typecheck, and
  format scripts but omits cos:gates. wu:done unconditionally runs pnpm cos:gates, so every fresh
  project fails its first wu:done. Additionally the wu:done error message suggests --skip-cos-gates
  which does not exist in the CLI; .logs/ is absent from the scaffolded .gitignore causing wu:done
  to block on untracked gates output; lane naming format and valid parents are not surfaced during
  init; wu:create reports validation errors one at a time requiring multiple retry cycles. Problem:
  A fresh project installed via lumenflow init cannot complete its first wu:done without manual
  workarounds — observed in Haven test project where setup required 12+ extra commits and 6+ failed
  command attempts to complete one documentation WU. Solution: Add cos:gates no-op stub to
  init-templates.ts alongside existing stubs; remove or correct --skip-cos-gates reference in
  wu-done error message; add .logs/ to scaffolded .gitignore template; print Parent: Sublane format
  requirement in lumenflow init output; collect all wu:create validation errors before throwing.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow init scaffolds cos:gates as a no-op script in package.json alongside lint, typecheck,
    and format stubs
  - wu:done error message for COS failures does not reference --skip-cos-gates or any flag that does
    not exist in wu:done --help
  - .logs/ is present in the .gitignore template scaffolded by lumenflow init
  - 'lumenflow init output displays the Parent: Sublane naming requirement and lists valid parent
    names before the user reaches lane:validate'
  - wu:create reports all spec validation errors in a single output rather than failing on the first
    error and requiring retry
