description: 'Context: lumenflow init scaffolds a new project with stubs for lint, typecheck, and format scripts but omits cos:gates. wu:done unconditionally runs pnpm cos:gates, so every fresh project fails its first wu:done. Additionally the wu:done error message suggests --skip-cos-gates which does not exist in the CLI; .logs/ is absent from the scaffolded .gitignore causing wu:done to block on untracked gates output; lane naming format and valid parents are not surfaced during init; wu:create reports validation errors one at a time requiring multiple retry cycles. Problem: A fresh project installed via lumenflow init cannot complete its first wu:done without manual workarounds — observed in Haven test project where setup required 12+ extra commits and 6+ failed command attempts to complete one documentation WU. Solution: Add cos:gates no-op stub to init-templates.ts alongside existing stubs; remove or correct --skip-cos-gates reference in wu-done error message; add .logs/ to scaffolded .gitignore template; print Parent: Sublane format requirement in lumenflow init output; collect all wu:create validation errors before throwing.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow init scaffolds cos:gates as a no-op script in package.json alongside lint, typecheck, and format stubs
  - wu:done error message for COS failures does not reference --skip-cos-gates or any flag that does not exist in wu:done --help
  - .logs/ is present in the .gitignore template scaffolded by lumenflow init
  - 'lumenflow init output displays the Parent: Sublane naming requirement and lists valid parent names before the user reaches lane:validate'
  - wu:create reports all spec validation errors in a single output rather than failing on the first error and requiring retry
