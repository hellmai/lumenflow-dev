description: 'Context: full wu:done gate runs intermittently fail on test timeouts that do not
  reproduce consistently in isolation. Problem: this blocks unrelated WU completion and release
  throughput. Solution: identify and harden timeout-sensitive tests so suite-level runs are stable
  under CI/worktree load.'
acceptance:
  - Flaky timeout failures are eliminated or materially reduced in repeated full test runs.
  - Updated timeout strategy is documented in test code where applied.
