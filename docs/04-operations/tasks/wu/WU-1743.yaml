description: 'Context: strict TypeScript debt was recently burned down to zero and we need durable guardrails to stop regressions. Problem: strict debt can creep back if no dedicated regression check is enforced in automation. Solution: add a fast CI step that runs strict:progress and add a focused test around pre-release check behavior to keep this contract visible and maintainable without slowing local WU completion loops.'
acceptance:
  - CI workflow runs pnpm strict:progress and fails on strict regression.
  - Guardrail remains fast and does not add strict:progress execution to wu:prep/wu:done local gates.
  - Pre-release checks include strict progress validation coverage via automated tests.
