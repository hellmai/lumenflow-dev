  Use p-retry for retry/backoff on non-fast-forward push retries.


  Add config for micro-worktree push retry (git.push_retry:
  enabled/retries/min_delay_ms/max_delay_ms/jitter) with sane defaults applied globally.

description: Add automatic rebase+retry behavior to micro-worktree push-only operations when
  origin/main has moved. Apply to all micro-worktree commands (wu:create, initiative:add/remove,
  etc.) to reduce non-fast-forward failures.
acceptance:
  - Non-fast-forward push triggers rebase onto origin/main and retries
  - Retry count is bounded and logged
  - Failure after max retries surfaces clear guidance
  - No behavior change when push succeeds first try
