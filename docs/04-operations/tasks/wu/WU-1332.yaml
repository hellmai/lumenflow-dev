description: Add automatic rebase+retry behavior to micro-worktree push-only operations when origin/main has moved. Apply to all micro-worktree commands (wu:create, initiative:add/remove, etc.) to reduce non-fast-forward failures.
acceptance:
  - Non-fast-forward push triggers rebase onto origin/main and retries
  - Retry count is bounded and logged
  - Failure after max retries surfaces clear guidance
  - No behavior change when push succeeds first try
