description: initiative:create fails when run from a non-main branch with local-mode safety rules.
  Since initiative:create uses micro-worktree isolation and auto-commits to main, the current branch
  should not matter. This blocks agents working in worktrees from creating initiatives.
acceptance:
  - initiative:create works from any branch (it already uses micro-worktree isolation)
  - 'Or: clear error message explaining why main branch is required with copy-paste fix'
