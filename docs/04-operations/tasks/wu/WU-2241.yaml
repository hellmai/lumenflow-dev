description: When the state store (wu-events.jsonl) gets out of sync, there is no CLI command to emit a corrective event. state:doctor detects mismatches but cannot fix them. A state:emit command would allow safe, audited manual correction without raw JSONL editing.
acceptance:
  - state:emit --type claim --wu WU-XXX appends a corrective claim event
  - state:emit --type release --wu WU-XXX appends a corrective release event
  - All emitted events include reason field and audit trail
  - state:doctor --fix uses state:emit internally for auto-repair
