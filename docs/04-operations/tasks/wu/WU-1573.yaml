description: 'Context: strict mode is still disabled in @lumenflow/core and @lumenflow/cli with a
  measured backlog of 1,862 strict errors. Problem: there is no first-class progress command or
  regression baseline to track strict debt burn-down safely across many parallel WUs. Solution: add
  strict-progress reporting and baseline artifacts, plus tests/guards so future WUs can reduce
  errors without drift.'
acceptance:
  - A CLI command surfaces per-package strict error counts and top TS error codes for core and cli
  - A machine-readable baseline artifact is generated and stored for regression tracking
  - Documentation/tests cover how to update baseline intentionally versus failing on regressions
  - tools/__tests__/tsconfig-strict.test.ts reports strict posture for core and cli without
    weakening current guarantees
  - The new reporting flow is usable from CI and local development
