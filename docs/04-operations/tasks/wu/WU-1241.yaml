description: "Context: The @lumenflow/core package contains spawn-monitor APIs for stuck detection,
  zombie lock recovery, and agent supervision. However, the CLI does not use these APIs - the
  supervision machinery exists but is disconnected. Problem: The orchestrate:monitor command exists
  but has a broken contract with core. Stuck spawns go undetected, zombie locks accumulate, and
  recovery is manual. This is the 'Gas Town' supervision gap. Solution: Rewire CLI
  orchestrate:monitor to properly call the spawn-monitor APIs in core. This includes: (1) stuck
  detection with configurable thresholds, (2) zombie lock identification and cleanup, (3) recovery
  actions (signal, restart, escalate), (4) status reporting for human oversight. The core APIs
  already exist - this WU wires them to the CLI surface."
acceptance:
  - orchestrate:monitor calls spawn-monitor APIs from @lumenflow/core
  - Stuck detection uses configurable timeout threshold (default 30min)
  - Zombie lock detection identifies abandoned WU locks
  - 'Recovery actions: signal agent, restart spawn, escalate to human'
  - 'Status output shows: active spawns, stuck spawns, zombie locks, recovery actions'
  - Dry-run mode shows what would be done without taking action
  - Unit tests verify API wiring and status formatting
  - Integration test confirms stuck detection works
  - Documentation updated
