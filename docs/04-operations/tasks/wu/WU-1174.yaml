description: "Context: wu:done runs from main checkout and acquires cleanup/merge locks. Problem:
  Lock files (cleanup.lock, merge.lock) are created in main's .lumenflow/ directory because
  getLockPath() defaults to process.cwd(). This violates worktree discipline (main should be
  read-only) and can cause 'Working tree is not clean' errors if process crashes. Solution: Move
  lock files to a dedicated temp directory using existing LUMENFLOW_PATHS constants pattern."
acceptance:
  - Lock files created in temp directory, not main checkout
  - Add LOCK_DIR constant to wu-constants.ts following existing pattern
  - Update merge-lock.ts and cleanup-lock.ts to use LOCK_DIR
  - Locks still work across processes (use os.tmpdir based path)
  - 'Library-first: evaluate proper-lockfile or similar before custom implementation'
  - Lock files created in temp directory, not main checkout
  - Add LOCK_DIR constant to wu-constants.ts following existing pattern
  - Update merge-lock.ts and cleanup-lock.ts to use LOCK_DIR
  - Locks still work across processes (use os.tmpdir based path)
