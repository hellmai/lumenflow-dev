description: 'Context: strict backlog concentration in CLI is highest in wu-done, wu-claim, and wu-edit. Problem: these hotspots dominate remaining CLI strict debt and block safe strict enablement in later waves. Solution: add explicit types, unknown-error normalization, and narrow data-shape guards across the three hotspots while preserving command behavior and test coverage.'
acceptance:
  - Strict errors are removed from wu-done, wu-claim, and wu-edit without behavioral regressions
  - Unknown/error handling uses shared helpers instead of ad-hoc any casts
  - No net increase in as any usage in the touched CLI files
  - CLI unit tests for touched commands pass
  - Progress baseline reflects reduced strict debt for touched files
