    - Run pnpm test --testNamePattern=guard and verify all 7 packages scanned with non-zero file
      counts

description: 'path-literal-guard.test.ts SCAN_TARGETS is missing @lumenflow/agent (7 files) and
  @lumenflow/metrics (13 files). status-literal-guard.test.ts only scans core/cli/memory AND uses
  regex — missing 4 packages and more brittle than path-literal-guard. Both guards must cover all 7
  runtime packages: core, cli, mcp, memory, initiatives, agent, metrics. status-literal-guard must
  be upgraded from regex to TypeScript AST for consistency with path-literal-guard.'
acceptance:
  - path-literal-guard SCAN_TARGETS includes agent and metrics packages
  - status-literal-guard SCAN_TARGETS includes all 7 runtime packages
  - status-literal-guard uses TypeScript AST scanning (ts.isStringLiteral) not regex
  - pnpm test --testNamePattern=guard passes with 0 violations (or ratcheted baseline)
  - Test output confirms non-zero file counts for agent and metrics in scan results
