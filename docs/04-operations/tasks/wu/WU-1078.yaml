description: wu:repair writes directly to main checkout instead of using micro-worktree isolation, violating LumenFlow's no-direct-main-writes principle
acceptance:
  - wu:repair uses micro-worktree for all file changes
  - No local files created in main checkout
  - All changes committed and pushed atomically via micro-worktree
