  manual:
    - Run lumenflow-integrate --sync in a fixture repo with partial scripts and verify missing wu:*
      aliases are added

notes: >-
  Implement in CLI integrate command by adding a package.json script sync step
  during --sync. Source aliases from public manifest via
  generateScriptsFromManifest(); add only missing keys and never overwrite
  existing custom scripts. Keep output explicit about whether aliases were
  added or already current.

description: 'Context: Consumer repos may have drifted package.json scripts and miss aliases like
  wu:status/wu:brief even when binaries are installed. Problem: Agents running pnpm wu:* hit
  command-not-found friction in older repos. Solution: Extend lumenflow-integrate --sync to also
  sync missing script aliases from the public command manifest without overwriting custom scripts.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow-integrate --sync adds missing script aliases from public manifest to package.json
  - Existing custom script entries are preserved
  - Integration tests cover alias sync behavior including wu:status and wu:brief
  - No regressions in integrate command flow
