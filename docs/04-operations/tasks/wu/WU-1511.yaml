description: 'Context: deleting WU-1007 removed the WU file but left stale references in status and
  initiative linkage. Problem: wu:delete can leave task projections inconsistent (dangling
  references to non-existent WU), which breaks trust in state views. Solution: harden wu:delete to
  atomically remove all references (WU file, backlog/status projections, initiative links) and
  validate no stale WU links remain after delete.'
acceptance:
  - Deleting a WU removes references from status/backlog projections and initiative linkage in one
    transaction
  - After wu:delete, no references to the deleted WU remain in
    docs/04-operations/tasks/{status,backlog}.md or linked initiatives
  - Add regression tests that fail before fix and pass after fix
