    - Run full pnpm gates and confirm no timeout failures in targeted core tests across two
      consecutive runs.

description: Intermittent gate failures occur in full-suite test runs due to 5s timeouts in core
  tests that pass in isolation. This blocks unrelated WUs at wu:prep/wu:done despite no
  deterministic regression in changed code.
acceptance:
  - Full-suite gates run without timeout failures in no-process-chdir and wu-repair-core related
    tests under normal CI/local conditions.
  - Behavioral intent of existing tests is preserved while runtime is made deterministic under
    full-suite load.
  - WU-1621 can reference this WU as fix-wu for audited skip-gates completion of pre-existing flake.
