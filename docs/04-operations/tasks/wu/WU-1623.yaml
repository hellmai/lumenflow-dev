title: Stabilize core full-suite timeout flake in gates
lane: 'Framework: Core State Recovery'
type: bug
status: ready
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-13

tests:
  manual:
    - Run full pnpm gates and confirm no timeout failures in targeted core tests across two consecutive runs.

description: Intermittent gate failures occur in full-suite test runs due to 5s timeouts in core tests that pass in isolation. This blocks unrelated WUs at wu:prep/wu:done despite no deterministic regression in changed code.
acceptance:
  - Full-suite gates run without timeout failures in no-process-chdir and wu-repair-core related tests under normal CI/local conditions.
  - Behavioral intent of existing tests is preserved while runtime is made deterministic under full-suite load.
  - WU-1621 can reference this WU as fix-wu for audited skip-gates completion of pre-existing flake.
