description: wu:done fails with 'Unexpected files staged' when turbo docs:generate creates MDX files
  in apps/docs/. The staging whitelist in wu-done.ts needs to include apps/docs/**/*.mdx.
  Additionally, agents don't know wu:cleanup is PR-only (requires merged PR when gh CLI available),
  causing confusion when they try to use it after wu:done failures.
acceptance:
  - Staging whitelist includes apps/docs/**/*.mdx pattern
  - wu:done succeeds when docs:generate creates new MDX files
  - 'Documentation updated: agents understand wu:cleanup is PR-only'
  - quick-ref-commands.md clarifies wu:done vs wu:cleanup usage
