description: Software-delivery pack migration needs an objective progress signal that can be
  enforced automatically. This WU adds a machine-readable scorecard and CI guardrail that tracks
  total software-delivery tools, pendingRuntimeMigrationTool usage, and real handler coverage so
  stub regression cannot silently re-enter the branch.
acceptance:
  - 'A scorecard check reports software-delivery totals: declared tools, pending-runtime entries,
    and real handler entries'
  - CI fails if pendingRuntimeMigrationTool usage increases from the established baseline
  - Scorecard output is machine-readable and can be consumed by release/readiness checks
