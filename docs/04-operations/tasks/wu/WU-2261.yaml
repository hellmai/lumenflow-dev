description: 'Context: completing a worktree WU can trigger broad worktree_path metadata rewrites across many WU YAML files and leave them staged on local main. Problem: this contaminates main with unrelated tracked changes and breaks dirty-main safety guarantees. Solution: constrain wu:done sanitization/migration writes to intended scope and ensure no staged residue remains on main after completion.'
acceptance:
  - Running wu:done for a single worktree WU does not stage unrelated WU YAML files on local main
  - worktree_path migration/sanitization cannot leave tracked staged or unstaged residue on main
  - Add regression test covering wu:done completion path and assert main remains clean
