description: The pack-1 tracer bullet requires core lifecycle operations to execute through real
  software-delivery pack handlers instead of pending migration stubs or implicit fallback behavior.
  This WU migrates wu:create, wu:claim, wu:prep, wu:done and required lifecycle support commands
  into native software-delivery handler implementations and updates resolver wiring accordingly.
acceptance:
  - Core lifecycle command set executes through software-delivery pack handlers in bootstrapped
    runtime mode
  - Manifest entries for migrated lifecycle commands no longer point to pendingRuntimeMigrationTool
  - Runtime path for migrated lifecycle commands completes without invoking CLI fallback
