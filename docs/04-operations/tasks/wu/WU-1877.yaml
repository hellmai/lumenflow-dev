notes: 'Sizing: Medium (M). ~15-20 files, ~40 tool calls. Strategy: Single Session. Shallow multi-file exception applies: uniform manifest pattern across 4 packs, each is ~50 lines. Wave 6b (after 6.3 for pattern reference). Combined with infra-ops = 5 community packs total, satisfying success metric 4.'

description: 'Context: Success metric 4 requires 5 community packs. infra-ops (WU-1874) provides 1. Problem: Need 4 more packs to satisfy the metric. Solution: Create manifest-only packs: data-pipeline, security-ops, legal-ops, compliance-audit. Each declares tools and policies following the software-delivery manifest pattern. Publish all to Vercel Blob registry via pack:publish. No tool implementations (stub pattern).'
acceptance:
  - data-pipeline pack manifest with relevant tools (etl:extract, etl:transform, etl:load, pipeline:status) and policies
  - security-ops pack manifest with relevant tools (scan:vulnerability, scan:dependency, audit:access, cert:renew) and policies
  - legal-ops pack manifest with relevant tools (contract:review, compliance:check, nda:generate) and policies
  - compliance-audit pack manifest with relevant tools (audit:run, audit:report, control:verify) and policies
  - All 4 packs validate via pack:validate and can be published via pack:publish
