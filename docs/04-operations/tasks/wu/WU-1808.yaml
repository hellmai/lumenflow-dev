description: 'Context: wu_done, wu_prep, wu_sandbox, wu_prune, wu_delete, wu_cleanup use
  runCliCommand. Problem: 6 shell-out call sites for highest-risk mutations (git merge, stamp,
  worktree removal). Solution: register in-process handlers for WU completion lifecycle.'
acceptance:
  - wu_done, wu_prep, wu_sandbox, wu_prune, wu_delete, wu_cleanup route through runtime.executeTool()
  - runCliCommand is NOT called for any of these 6 tools
  - Full WU lifecycle (create to done) works end-to-end via runtime path
