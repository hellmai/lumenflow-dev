notes: 'Sizing: Simple (expected 4-8 files, <50 tool calls). Strategy: Single Session with
  feature-flag discipline and rollback-safe defaults. Classification corrected to feature because it
  introduces new compatibility guard + telemetry behavior.'

description: Runtime-first routing currently needs a controlled migration mode so partially migrated
  software-delivery commands can continue operating while handlers are moved from CLI fallback to
  native pack execution. This WU introduces an explicit compatibility guard and structured telemetry
  around fallback decisions to make temporary fallback visible, auditable, and easy to disable.
acceptance:
  - A dedicated migration fallback error code is supported only when migration compatibility guard
    is enabled
  - Fallback events include structured telemetry fields needed for migration observability (tool
    name, reason, workspace root)
  - Strict mode disables migration fallback path and returns explicit failure for unmigrated handlers
