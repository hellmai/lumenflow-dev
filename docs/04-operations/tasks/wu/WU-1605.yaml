    - Execute delegated claim and completion scenarios and confirm policy outcomes for intent-only,
      pickup-confirmed, and override paths.

description: Current provenance can only prove delegation intent, not that an agent actually picked
  up delegated work. Add a claim-time handshake (e.g. delegated-by metadata) and evolve wu:done
  checks so completion policy can validate both intent and pickup evidence with auditable override
  behavior.
acceptance:
  - wu:claim supports recording delegated pickup metadata tied to prior delegation intent.
  - wu:done enforcement distinguishes intent-only records from confirmed pickup and reports
    actionable remediation.
  - Automated tests cover success, missing-pickup, and audited override paths for
    initiative-governed WUs.
