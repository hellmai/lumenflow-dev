description: 'Context: Phase 4 wave-0 established the deprecation baseline and guardrail. Phase 3
  performed the actual migration. Problem: Phase 4 evidence needs to be updated with post-migration
  measurements. Solution: recompute shell-out inventory, update wave evidence in roadmap, re-close
  Phase 4 with post-migration proof.'
acceptance:
  - Shell-out inventory recomputed and documented with measured counts
  - Roadmap wave evidence updated with actual migration results and gate outcomes
  - INIT-030 Phase 4 status re-closed with post-migration recertification
  - Any remaining shell-outs have owner, rationale, and removal date documented
