description: |
  Create the public documentation site for LumenFlow at lumenflow.dev.

  Context: Before Marketplace listing, need proper docs so users
  can understand and adopt LumenFlow.

  Problem: No user-facing documentation exists. Internal docs are
  operational, not onboarding-focused.

  Solution: Static docs site with clear information architecture.
acceptance:
  - Site deployed to lumenflow.dev (or docs.lumenflow.dev)
  - Home page explains what LumenFlow is
  - Concepts section covers WUs, Lanes, Gates
  - CLI reference documents all commands
  - GitHub App section explains installation
  - Search functionality works
