    - Run wu:claim and confirm Project Defaults are shown to the agent; run wu:spawn with and without --client and verify blocks/skills guidance change accordingly.

description: |-
  Context: Teams want default methodology guidance (TDD, hex, SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS, library-first)
  while keeping it flexible for different clients and projects.
  Problem: There is no structured config to express methodology defaults or client-specific agent blocks;
  wu:claim and wu:spawn do not consistently surface these defaults to agents.
  Solution: extend config schema with methodology defaults + client blocks, have wu:claim emit an agent-only
  "Project Defaults" section, and have wu:spawn inject client-specific blocks/skills guidance based on the
  resolved client, with docs and tests updated.
acceptance:
  - Config schema adds methodology defaults and client block definitions with validation and safe defaults.
  - wu:claim emits an agent-only 'Project Defaults' section derived from config (not user-facing).
  - wu:spawn injects client-specific blocks and skills guidance based on resolved client (CLI arg, then config default, then fallback).
  - Docs updated for config fields and CLI behavior in Starlight and internal quick-ref.
  - Unit tests cover config parsing plus spawn/claim output selection for defaults and overrides.
