description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 agent report showed that adding a separate AI agents page is
  wrong approach. Problem: Current quickstart is descriptive, not imperative. It explains concepts
  first and shows file locations, implying manual editing is okay. Agents default to file
  manipulation. Solution: Rewrite quickstart as step-by-step command sequence with explicit Do NOT
  warnings, imperative language, and no branches. Every action should be a CLI command.'
acceptance:
  - Quickstart uses imperative language (Run this not You can run this)
  - Sequential steps with no or you could branches
  - Explicit DO NOT warnings after each step
  - Commands shown before concepts explained
  - Common Mistakes table with check and X symbols
  - File Ownership table showing managed vs user files
  - Agent entry route exists (lumenflow.dev/agent) OR banner on all pages
