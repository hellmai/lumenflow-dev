tests:
  manual:
    - Quickstart includes explicit "Do NOT edit managed files" warnings near init and WU creation
      steps.
    - Quickstart presents a single command-first sequence (install → init → initiative:create →
      wu:create → wu:claim → wu:prep → wu:done) without branching options.
    - Quickstart includes a File Ownership table (managed vs user-owned) and a Common Mistakes table
      with check/X symbols.
    - Quickstart does not instruct manual edits to .lumenflow.config.yaml or manual creation of
      WU/initiative YAML files.

description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 agent report showed that adding a separate AI agents page is
  wrong approach. Problem: Current quickstart is descriptive, not imperative. It explains concepts
  first and shows file locations, implying manual editing is okay. Agents default to file
  manipulation. Solution: Rewrite quickstart as step-by-step command sequence with explicit Do NOT
  warnings, imperative language, and no branches. Every action should be a CLI command.'
acceptance:
  - Quickstart uses imperative language (Run this not You can run this)
  - Sequential steps with no or you could branches
  - Explicit DO NOT warnings after each step
  - Commands shown before concepts explained
  - Common Mistakes table with check and X symbols
  - File Ownership table showing managed vs user files
  - Quickstart includes an agent callout banner at the top with "Follow these steps exactly"
    guidance.
