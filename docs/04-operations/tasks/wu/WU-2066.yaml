description: The release script commits version bumps on main, but the pre-commit worktree
  discipline hook blocks all main commits when other agents have active worktrees. Release
  operations should be allowed regardless of worktree state.
acceptance:
  - Release script sets LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL=release before git commit
  - Worktree discipline hook allows commits when LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL=release
