description: Introduce a side-effectful delegation command that records lineage intent explicitly while keeping prompt generation behavior pure. Integrate orchestration flows to use delegation semantics where appropriate without falsely implying automatic execution.
acceptance:
  - wu:delegate records delegation lineage intentionally and emits or references briefing output for the target WU.
  - Orchestration pathways use delegation semantics consistently without claiming execution when only prompts are generated.
  - Spawn/delegation monitoring commands continue to function with the updated event model and messaging.
