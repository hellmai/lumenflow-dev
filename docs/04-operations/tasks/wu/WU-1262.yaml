description: >-
  Update gates to use resolvePolicy() for determining enforcement defaults. The resolved policy
  should inform:

  - Coverage threshold (90% for tdd, 70% for test-after, 0% for none)

  - Coverage mode (block for tdd, warn for test-after, off for none)

  - Test gate severity (required for tdd/test-after, warn for none)


  Explicit gates.* config must still override methodology defaults per the precedence rules.
acceptance:
  - Gates reads resolved policy from resolvePolicy(config)
  - Coverage threshold defaults derived from methodology.testing
  - Coverage mode defaults derived from methodology.testing
  - Explicit gates.* overrides take precedence over methodology defaults
  - Existing gate behavior unchanged with default methodology
