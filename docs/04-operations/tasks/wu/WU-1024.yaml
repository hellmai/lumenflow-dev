description: WU-1017 pre-push hook blocks ALL pushes to main, including CLI tools (wu:create,
  wu:edit, wu:done) which legitimately need to push via micro-worktrees. The hook should detect
  CLI-initiated operations and allow them.
acceptance:
  - pre-push allows pushes from tmp/wu-* branches (CLI micro-worktrees)
  - pre-push still blocks manual git push to main
  - wu:create, wu:edit work without LUMENFLOW_FORCE
