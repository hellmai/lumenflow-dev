description: 'Context: gates.ts runSpecLinterGate attempts scoped wu:validate but still always runs
  global spec:linter, and WU detection is based on process cwd. Problem: unrelated WU YAML failures
  (e.g. WU-1605 missing spec_refs) can block completions, especially when getCurrentWU cannot detect
  from non-process cwd. Solution: detect WU from gate cwd and run global spec:linter only when
  scoped WU cannot be determined.'
acceptance:
  - runSpecLinterGate uses gate cwd to resolve current branch/WU
  - when current WU is detected, spec:linter gate validates only that WU and does not run global
    wu:validate --all
  - when current WU cannot be detected, global spec:linter fallback remains
