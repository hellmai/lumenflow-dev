description: spawn-registry.jsonl is runtime coordination state created by wu:spawn provenance flows. It is local/session-specific and should not appear as an untracked repository change on main checkouts. Add git ignore coverage so this state artifact never surfaces as pending code work.
acceptance:
  - Creating .lumenflow/state/spawn-registry.jsonl does not show in git status.
  - Existing tracked workflow state files remain unchanged in behavior.
  - No other runtime state ignore rules regress.
