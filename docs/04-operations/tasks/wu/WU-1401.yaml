description: Tighten the agent quickstart to require lumenflow-doctor checks, treat enforcement errors as blockers, provide explicit fix commands for Husky/safe-git, and require initiative creation for multi-phase projects.
acceptance:
  - Quickstart instructs to run pnpm exec lumenflow-doctor (not lumenflow doctor) and treat errors as blockers
  - Quickstart includes explicit fix commands for Husky and safe-git, gated by user approval
  - Quickstart requires initiative creation when user indicates multi-phase or vision
