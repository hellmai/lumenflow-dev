description: Tighten the agent quickstart to require lumenflow-doctor checks, treat enforcement
  errors as blockers, provide explicit fix commands for Husky/safe-git, and require initiative
  creation for multi-phase projects.
acceptance:
  - Quickstart instructs to run pnpm exec lumenflow-doctor (not lumenflow doctor) and treat errors
    as blockers
  - Quickstart includes explicit fix commands for Husky and safe-git, gated by user approval
  - Quickstart requires initiative creation when user indicates multi-phase or vision
