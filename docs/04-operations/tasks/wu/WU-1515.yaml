title: Eliminate post-merge dirty-state loops in wu:done
lane: 'Framework: CLI WU Commands'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P2
created: 2026-02-07
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-done.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/wu-done-validation.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/wu-done-worktree.ts

  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/__tests__/wu-done-dirty-main.test.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - From a clean main checkout, run `pnpm wu:done --id WU-1515 --skip-gates --reason "test" --fix-wu WU-1516`
      with only `.lumenflow/flow.log` or skip-gates audit logs dirty; verify wu:done no longer fails on
      post-merge dirty-state handling for those internal files.
    - Repeat with an unrelated dirty file (for example `README.md`) and verify wu:done still blocks with a
      clear dirty-main error.

description: 'Context: wu:done can still end in partial-state recovery paths when tool-generated
  state changes (flow/audit files) appear during completion, forcing repeated retries and manual
  repair. Problem: post-merge dirty-state handling is brittle. Solution: make wu:done completion
  resilient to internal state-file churn and fail deterministically with a single actionable path
  when true external dirtiness exists.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done does not fail due to internally generated state-file modifications during its own
    completion path
  - Dirty-main checks distinguish internal lifecycle writes from unrelated user dirtiness
  - Regression tests cover re-entrant wu:done execution without requiring manual stash/repair loops
