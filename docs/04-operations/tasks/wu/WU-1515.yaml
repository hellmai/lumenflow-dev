description: 'Context: wu:done can still end in partial-state recovery paths when tool-generated state changes (flow/audit files) appear during completion, forcing repeated retries and manual repair. Problem: post-merge dirty-state handling is brittle. Solution: make wu:done completion resilient to internal state-file churn and fail deterministically with a single actionable path when true external dirtiness exists.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done does not fail due to internally generated state-file modifications during its own completion path
  - Dirty-main checks distinguish internal lifecycle writes from unrelated user dirtiness
  - Regression tests cover re-entrant wu:done execution without requiring manual stash/repair loops
