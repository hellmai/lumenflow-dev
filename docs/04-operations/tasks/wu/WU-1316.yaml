description: "Context: onboarding tests show wu:create reports one missing field at a time, causing iterative failures. Problem: users don't see the full required-field set. Solution: aggregate required-field validation errors and print them together (including code_paths, test_paths, and spec_refs requirements)."
acceptance:
  - Missing required fields are reported together in a single error block
  - Feature WUs missing spec_refs surface the spec_refs requirement in the same error block
  - Unit tests cover aggregated error output
