description: 'Context: stamp, state, and docs paths are duplicated as hardcoded literals across CLI and core files. Problem: duplicated literals drift and increase semantic and maintenance risk. Solution: centralize constants in shared modules and replace duplicated path literals with imports from canonical constants.'
acceptance:
  - Hardcoded stamp and wu-events path literals are replaced with centralized constants where available.
  - Duplicated local constants are removed in favor of shared constants.
  - Path-literal regression tests validate no reintroduction of banned literals.
