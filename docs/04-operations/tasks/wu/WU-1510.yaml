description: 'Context: Medium article (WU-1506, WU-1507) reads as AI slop despite editorial improvements. Problems: staccato copywriter cadence, no origin story, product appears fully formed, private repo name exposed, jargon before definition, every section identical beat. Solution: full rewrite with British vernacular (Fry/Dawkins voice research), ExampleApp evolution narrative, varied structure, real uncertainty.'
acceptance:
  - Article uses British English vernacular throughout
  - LumenFlow origin story shows evolution from ExampleApp guardrails, not a designed product
  - No private repo name (hellmai/os) exposed
  - 'No AI slop patterns: staccato negation, mirror sentences, rhetorical barrages, Here is what transitions'
  - Work Unit terminology introduced after concept is explained, not before
  - Code snippets remain real source (not regressed from WU-1507 fixes)
