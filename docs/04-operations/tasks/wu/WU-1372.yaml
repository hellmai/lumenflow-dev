description: "Context: Haven 2.8.0 testing showed agents fetch quickstart via WebFetch but it has no initiative guidance. Problem: Agent jumped straight to wu:create without understanding initiatives, created orphan WUs on main. Solution: Add prominent 'When to Use Initiatives' section before the wu:create examples in quickstart.mdx."
acceptance:
  - Quickstart has 'When to Use Initiatives' section before Step 4
  - Section includes pnpm initiative:create example
  - Section explains when to skip initiatives (small fixes)
