description: "findStrippedKeys() (config-set.ts:432) compares the full normalized pack config
  against Zod-parsed output to detect stripped unknown keys. The check runs on the entire config
  tree at line 734, not just the sub-path being written. If a workspace has a pre-existing unknown
  key anywhere (e.g. software_delivery.gates.legacy_unknown), writing to a completely different path
  (e.g. software_delivery.methodology.testing=test-after) is rejected with 'Unknown config key(s)
  rejected: gates.legacy_unknown'. The stripping check must be scoped to the write target path while
  preserving strictness for that targeted path."
acceptance:
  - Unknown-key enforcement is scoped to the sub-path being written, not the full pack config tree
  - Writes to valid paths succeed even when pre-existing unknown keys exist elsewhere in the same
    pack config
  - Strictness is preserved for the targeted write path — unknown keys within the write target are
    still rejected
  - 'Tests cover: pre-existing unrelated unknown key does not block valid write; unknown key within
    the write target path is still rejected; clean config write works as before'
