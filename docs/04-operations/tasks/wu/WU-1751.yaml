title: Prevent lane lifecycle migration side-effects in wu:create and initiative:create
lane: 'Framework: Core State Recovery'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-16
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/lane-lifecycle-process.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-create.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/initiative-create.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Run wu:create or initiative:create in a repo with lane artifacts but no lanes.lifecycle.status;
      verify .lumenflow.config.yaml is not rewritten as a side effect.
  unit:

    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/initiative-create-lifecycle.test.ts

description: 'Context: lane lifecycle migration was introduced with deferred lane process. Problem:
  wu:create and initiative:create call ensureLaneLifecycleForProject(..., { persist: true }), which
  rewrites .lumenflow.config.yaml on main for legacy repos missing lanes.lifecycle.status. This
  strips comments and reformats config unexpectedly, creating dirty-main side effects unrelated to
  the user command intent. Solution: make these commands read lane lifecycle in non-mutating mode
  (persist: false) and keep migration writes scoped to explicit lane lifecycle commands only.'
acceptance:
  - wu:create reads lane lifecycle without rewriting .lumenflow.config.yaml on main
  - initiative:create reads lane lifecycle without rewriting .lumenflow.config.yaml on main
  - Unit tests cover read-only lane lifecycle resolution for these command entrypoints
