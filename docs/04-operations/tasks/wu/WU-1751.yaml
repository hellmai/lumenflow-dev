description: 'Context: WU-1552 and WU-1553 are intentionally status=superseded in YAML, but they still have historical claim/release events in .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl. Problem: state:doctor derives status=ready from events and reports status mismatch as auto-fixable, but --fix cannot reconcile ready->superseded. This creates persistent noise and recurring confusion (looks like random WUs reappearing). Solution: update state-doctor mismatch detection/fixability semantics so non-canonical terminal YAML statuses (e.g., superseded/cancelled) are not flagged as auto-fixable state drift. Ensure messaging reflects true fixability.'
acceptance:
  - state:doctor does not report auto-fixable status mismatch for YAML status superseded with derived ready
  - state:doctor output correctly marks non-fixable transitions as non-auto-fixable
  - state-doctor core tests cover superseded/cancelled mismatch behavior
