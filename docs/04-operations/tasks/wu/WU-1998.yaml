description: wu:done currently warns 'No checkpoints found' even in warn mode where it auto-creates a pre-gates checkpoint moments later. Replace with accurate informational messaging while keeping block-mode enforcement unchanged.
acceptance:
  - warn mode no longer emits failure-style 'No checkpoints found' warning
  - block mode still hard-fails when checkpoints are required and missing
  - tests cover updated warn-mode messaging and preserved block-mode semantics
