tests:
  manual:
    - Attempt wu:done on a WU claimed by another agent/session; verify block and verify --force
      override logs audit
    - Attempt raw @lumenflow version bump via package.json/pnpm-lock.yaml edit; verify pre-commit
      and CI fail without marker
    - Attempt direct docs/04-operations/tasks/wu/*.yaml edit; verify pre-commit and CI fail without
      wu:edit stamp

description: 'Problem: agents bypass workflow by running raw @lumenflow package updates, directly
  editing WU YAML, or completing WUs they did not claim. Enforcement logic must live in the CLI so
  it propagates automatically on upgrade — scaffolded files (pre-commit, CI) should be stable
  one-liner delegators. Solution: (1) wu:done ownership check in CLI; (2) lumenflow:pre-commit-check
  CLI command containing all check logic; (3) thin .husky/pre-commit and CI templates that delegate
  to it; (4) lumenflow:integrate --sync migration for existing repos.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done blocks completion when current agent/session did not claim the WU, with a --force escape
    hatch and explicit audit event
  - lumenflow:upgrade writes an upgrade marker under .lumenflow/state for the current upgrade
    operation
  - pre-commit blocks commits that change @lumenflow/* versions in package.json or pnpm-lock.yaml
    without a valid upgrade marker
  - CI fails with the same upgrade-marker rule used by pre-commit
  - wu:edit writes an edit event/stamp for changed WU YAML paths
  - pre-commit and CI block WU YAML edits that lack corresponding wu:edit event/stamp
