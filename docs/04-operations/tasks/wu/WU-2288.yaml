description: 'Context: wu:done currently enforces brief evidence, which is late and causes wasted cycles when teams discover missing brief only at completion. Problem: autonomous orchestration needs earlier and policy-driven enforcement. Solution: add wu:prep enforcement that validates wu:brief evidence according to policy mode (required blocks, auto warns/regenerates guidance, manual/off skip), with actionable remediation and force-bypass audit trail parity.'
acceptance:
  - wu:prep enforces brief evidence when policy mode is required and blocks with clear remediation
  - wu:prep does not block for manual/off modes
  - auto mode surfaces warning/remediation if evidence missing without hard block
  - force bypass path preserves explicit audit reason in logs/events
  - unit tests cover required/pass/fail and mode branching
  - pnpm gates passes
