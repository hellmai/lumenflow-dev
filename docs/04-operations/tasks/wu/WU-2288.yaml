title: Enforce wu:brief policy at wu:prep with mode-aware blocking
lane: 'Framework: CLI WU Commands'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P1
created: 2026-03-01

  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-prep.ts

tests:
  manual:
    - Set mode required and run wu:prep without brief evidence; verify block message and remediation
      steps
    - Set mode manual/off and run wu:prep without brief evidence; verify no block

notes: 'Added wu:prep policy enforcement path with mode-aware behavior (off/manual skip, auto warn, required block unless force+reason). Added explicit prep bypass audit checkpoint and shared brief evidence helper in core event sourcer; covered with unit tests in wu-prep, wu-done, and wu-event-sourcer test suites.'

description: 'Context: wu:done currently enforces brief evidence, which is late and causes wasted
  cycles when teams discover missing brief only at completion. Problem: autonomous orchestration
  needs earlier and policy-driven enforcement. Solution: add wu:prep enforcement that validates
  wu:brief evidence according to policy mode (required blocks, auto warns/regenerates guidance,
  manual/off skip), with actionable remediation and force-bypass audit trail parity.'
acceptance:
  - wu:prep enforces brief evidence when policy mode is required and blocks with clear remediation
  - wu:prep does not block for manual/off modes
  - auto mode surfaces warning/remediation if evidence missing without hard block
  - force bypass path preserves explicit audit reason in logs/events
  - unit tests cover required/pass/fail and mode branching
  - pnpm gates passes
