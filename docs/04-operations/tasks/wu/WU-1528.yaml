description: "Context: wu:delete is the supported lifecycle command for removing obsolete WUs.
  Problem: deleting WU-1489 failed with 'fatal: pathspec ... did not match any files' after file
  deletion/regeneration, causing wu:delete to abort and forcing manual/admin workaround. Solution:
  make wu:delete staging robust when target WU YAML is already removed in the micro-worktree, and
  ensure command completes atomically (events + projections + commit/push)."
acceptance:
  - pnpm wu:delete --id <ready-wu> completes without fatal pathspec errors
  - Deleted WU file, wu-events cleanup, and backlog/status regeneration are committed and pushed
    atomically
  - Regression test reproduces the pathspec failure case and passes after fix
