description: Update contributor-facing entrypoint docs so AGENTS.md and LUMENFLOW.md consistently point to the canonical lifecycle map and failure runbook, reducing duplicate/contradictory guidance.
acceptance:
  - AGENTS.md references canonical lifecycle + troubleshooting docs instead of duplicating workflow details
  - LUMENFLOW.md references the same canonical lifecycle + troubleshooting docs and command ordering
  - Cross-links are consistent and do not conflict with quick-start local/cloud sections
