description: 'Context: wu-spawn.test.ts has 18 pre-existing sonarjs/no-duplicate-string errors and 5 sonarjs/publicly-writable-directories warnings. Problem: These are flagged when any change is made to the file, blocking legitimate WU work. Solution: Refactor test fixtures to use shared constants and address security warnings.'
acceptance:
  - All lint errors in wu-spawn.test.ts resolved
  - No new lint errors introduced
