notes: >-
  Re-enabled 4 security rules (detect-non-literal-regexp, detect-unsafe-regex,
  no-os-command-from-path, publicly-writable-directories) across CLI, core, and
  initiatives packages. Added 56 targeted eslint-disable-next-line comments with
  justifications. Kept detect-non-literal-fs-filename (907 FPs) and
  detect-object-injection (287 FPs) as package-level disables with rationale.
  Pre-existing test failures in init-scripts.test.ts and no-process-chdir.test.ts
  are tracked in WU-1551. TODO comments in eslint.config.mjs are legitimate code
  annotations (sonarjs/todo-tag is intentionally disabled).
