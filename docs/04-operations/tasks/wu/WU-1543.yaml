description: 'Context: Security lint rules are blanket-disabled for CLI and core packages. Problem: rules that catch command injection, object injection, and unsafe regex are turned off. Solution: re-enable security/* and sonarjs/no-os-command-from-path rules, fix violations with targeted eslint-disable-next-line or code fixes.'
acceptance:
  - Security lint rules (security/*, sonarjs/no-os-command-from-path) are re-enabled in eslint.config.mjs.
  - Violations are fixed with code changes or targeted eslint-disable-next-line with justification comments.
  - pnpm lint passes with re-enabled rules in CI-equivalent mode.
