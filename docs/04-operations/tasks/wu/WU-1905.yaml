    - Execute flow:report and metrics:snapshot through runtime path and verify expected output

notes: 'Sizing: Simple (expected 8-12 files, <50 tool calls). Strategy: Single Session. Gap identified during INIT-030 Phase 6 dry-run audit — these 4 flow/metrics tools were not covered by any existing WU.'

description: 'Gap fill: flow:bottlenecks, flow:report, metrics, and metrics:snapshot have in-process handlers in runtime-tool-resolver.ts but are not explicitly assigned to any Phase 6 migration WU. These 4 tools must be migrated from resolver fallback stubs to native software-delivery pack handlers.'
acceptance:
  - flow:bottlenecks, flow:report, metrics, and metrics:snapshot execute through software-delivery handlers in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated flow and metrics commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated flow/metrics commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration mode
