description: 'Context: Testing lumenflow init on lumenflow-cloud revealed two cosmetic bugs in CLI
  output. Problem: (1) lumenflow doctor prints entire health check output twice -- likely same
  double-call pattern as the scaffold dedup issue fixed in WU-1965. (2) During init, prerequisite
  warning says git version 2.43.0 (requires >=2.0.0) which reads like a failure even though the
  check passes -- the warning prefix and format are misleading for passing checks. Solution: (1)
  Find and eliminate duplicate doctor invocation. (2) Change prerequisite output to clearly
  distinguish passing vs failing checks -- passing checks should use a checkmark, only failing ones
  should use the warning prefix.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow doctor output appears exactly once (no duplicate)
  - Passing prerequisite checks show a checkmark not a warning prefix
  - Failing prerequisite checks still show warning prefix with actionable guidance
