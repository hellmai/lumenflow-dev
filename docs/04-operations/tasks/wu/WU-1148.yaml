description: wu:done runs docs:generate which creates cli.mdx and config.mdx, but these files are
  not formatted with prettier before staging. This causes every subsequent agent to see dirty mdx
  files on their worktree, blocking work.
acceptance:
  - DOC_OUTPUT_FILES are formatted with prettier after docs:generate runs
  - No uncommitted mdx changes after wu:done completes
