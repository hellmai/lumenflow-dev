description: 'Context: dist-path imports bypass package API contracts and wildcard exports allow
  unrestricted internal coupling. Problem: internal module layout is exposed as de facto public API.
  Solution: add explicit subpath exports to 4 packages (additive, while wildcards still exist), then
  codemod all 569 dist import lines to use new public subpaths.'
acceptance:
  - Explicit subpath exports added to core, memory, initiatives, and agent package.json files.
  - All consumer imports migrated from @lumenflow/*/dist/* to supported public subpaths.
  - pnpm build, pnpm typecheck, and pnpm test pass after codemod.
