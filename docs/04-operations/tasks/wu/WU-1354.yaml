description: Agents sometimes fail to act when users imply action (e.g., 'so update 1348 then?'). Add Mistake 12 to first-wu-mistakes.md, update wu-workflow.md anti-patterns, and make wu:edit more discoverable.
acceptance:
  - Mistake 12 added to first-wu-mistakes.md with Wrong/Right examples
  - wu-workflow.md has 2 new anti-pattern entries
  - wu:edit added to starting-prompt.md commands table
