      duplicated inline literals for targeted categories.

description: Complete post-WU-1764 literal cleanup by extracting remaining run status, handler kind,
  and repeated error code literals into shared constants/types used by schemas and runtime logic.
acceptance:
  - Run status literals are represented via shared constants/types and consumed by
    schemas/runtime/event store.
  - Handler kind literals are centralized and reused across runtime/tool-host paths.
  - Repeated error code literals are consolidated into constants where reuse threshold is met.
