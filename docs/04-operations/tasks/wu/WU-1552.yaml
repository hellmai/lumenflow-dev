description: 'Context: Architecture audit plan was sized per wu-sizing-guide.md, splitting 3 oversized WUs and adding 3 new tracks. Problem: Existing WU specs and INIT-020 phases need updating to match the approved 15-WU plan. Solution: narrow WU-1535/1536/1539 scope, update INIT-020 to 15 phases with WU ID mapping.'
acceptance:
  - WU-1535 narrowed to B1 (strict TS only), WU-1536 narrowed to C1 (codemod only), WU-1539 narrowed to E1 (path literals only).
  - INIT-020 phases expanded to 15 with WU ID mapping and phase 8 marked done.
