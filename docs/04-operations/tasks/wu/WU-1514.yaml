description: 'Context: state:doctor still reports Broken Event entries for deleted WUs (currently
  WU-1007). Problem: wu:delete/projection cleanup leaves orphaned event history that fails
  consistency checks. Solution: harden delete and/or doctor-fix paths so deleted WUs no longer leave
  broken events in wu-events.jsonl or equivalent archival representation.'
acceptance:
  - After deleting a WU, pnpm state:doctor reports no Broken Event for that WU
  - wu:delete cleanup covers event-store consistency, not just file/projection links
  - Regression tests reproduce the pre-fix failure and pass post-fix
