description: 'Context: Agent onboarding docs live in a top-level ai/onboarding folder, separate from
  the canonical operations framework docs. Problem: this breaks documentation locality and makes it
  easy to miss updates when reorganizing the LumenFlow framework docs. Solution: move ai/onboarding
  into docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/ai/onboarding and update all documentation
  references accordingly.'
acceptance:
  - Move ai/onboarding contents into docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/ai/onboarding.
  - Remove the top-level ai/onboarding directory.
  - Update doc references (CLAUDE.md, LUMENFLOW.md, playbook, backlog, sizing guide) to the new path.
  - pnpm gates --docs-only -> PASS
