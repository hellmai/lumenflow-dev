description: 'Context: Framework: CLI and Framework: Core are broad single-lock lanes that serialize unrelated work. Problem: one in-progress WU blocks unrelated command/core work even when code_paths do not overlap. Solution: add finer-grained sub-lanes for high-contention domains, retain legacy compatibility lanes, align inference taxonomy, and remove known lane-overlap patterns.'
acceptance:
  - 'Lane definitions introduce narrower CLI/Core sub-lanes plus Framework: MCP, while preserving legacy Framework: CLI/Core lanes for backward compatibility.'
  - Infrastructure/docs overlap is removed by narrowing Operations infrastructure paths away from docs app paths.
  - Lane inference taxonomy is updated to recommend the new lanes and remains valid for wu:create suggestions.
  - Lane health no longer reports the previous apps/** vs apps/docs/** overlap and demonstrates improved coverage.
  - Sub-lane documentation is updated with migration guidance for existing WUs.
