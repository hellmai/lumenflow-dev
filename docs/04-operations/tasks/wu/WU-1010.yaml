notes: |-
  Example repos show LumenFlow in action for different ecosystems.

  Repos to create:
  - hellmai/lumenflow-example-node
  - hellmai/lumenflow-example-python
  - hellmai/lumenflow-example-go

  Each should have:
  - .lumenflow.config.yaml
  - Sample WU specs
  - Working gates for that language
  - README pointing to docs

description: |
  Create example repositories showing LumenFlow setup for
  Node.js, Python, and Go projects.

  Context: Users want to see LumenFlow in action before adopting.
  Different language ecosystems have different tooling.

  Problem: No reference implementations to copy from.

  Solution: Minimal example repos for major ecosystems.
acceptance:
  - Node.js example repo with ESLint/Prettier/TypeScript gates
  - Python example repo with ruff/mypy gates
  - Go example repo with gofmt/golint gates
  - Each repo has sample WU specs
  - Each repo README links to docs
