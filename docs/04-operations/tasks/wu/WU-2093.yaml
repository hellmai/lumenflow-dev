description: Replace brittle regex-only literal guard logic with AST-based detection and broaden
  enforcement coverage across core, cli, mcp, memory, and initiatives while preserving explicit
  allowlists for valid template/schema contexts.
acceptance:
  - path literal guard detection is AST-based for string/template literals in runtime source files
  - guard coverage includes core, cli, mcp, memory, and initiatives packages with explicit
    allowlisted contexts
  - workspace.yaml token checks avoid false positives such as pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - guard tests include positive, negative, and boundary scenarios for all banned literal categories
  - no custom regex-only ESLint path-literal rule is introduced; enforcement remains AST-based and
    shared
