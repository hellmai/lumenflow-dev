notes: Added validateMainNotBehindOrigin() pre-transaction check and rollbackMainAfterMergeFailure()
  to wu-done-worktree.ts. The pre-transaction check aborts before any file writes when local main is
  behind origin. The catch block now captures preMainMergeSha before merge and resets main to it if
  push/rebase fails post-merge, preventing wu-events.jsonl/backlog/status leaks.

description: 'Context: A failed wu:done retry for WU-1575 leaked .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl
  changes into the local main checkout, including a complete event that should not persist after
  rollback. Problem: the failure path rolls back lane branch state but can leave main dirty when
  main is behind origin or merge/rebase fails after metadata mutation. Solution: hard-fail early
  when main is behind origin before any transaction writes, and extend rollback/recovery to restore
  main checkout state so wu-events/backlog/status never leak after failed wu:done.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done aborts before transaction writes when local main is behind origin/main
  - on merge/rebase failure after metadata mutation, main checkout remains clean (no
    wu-events/backlog/status leakage)
  - failed wu:done does not leave a local complete event for the target WU in
    .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl
  - idempotent retry path still succeeds after syncing main
