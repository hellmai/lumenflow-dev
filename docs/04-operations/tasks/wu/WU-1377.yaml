description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 agent report showed agent edited .lumenflow.config.yaml manually because no warning indicated it was managed. Problem: Generated files look like regular YAML, agents assume they should edit them. Solution: Add prominent header comments to generated files indicating they are Lumenflow-managed and suggesting CLI alternatives.'
acceptance:
  - Config template has LUMENFLOW MANAGED FILE header block
  - Header includes warning about manual edits
  - Header suggests CLI commands for customization
  - Lane-inference template also has managed header
