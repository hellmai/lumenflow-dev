description: 'Context: initiative:edit supports --add-success-metric but no remove counterpart. Problem: agents cannot correct mistaken or superseded metrics without manual file edits, creating workflow friction and policy violations. Solution: add --remove-success-metric (repeatable) with idempotent behavior and tests covering add/remove interplay.'
acceptance:
  - initiative:edit accepts --remove-success-metric <text> as repeatable option.
  - Removing a metric deletes exact matches from success_metrics and is idempotent when metric is absent.
  - Combined add/remove in one invocation yields deterministic results (remove applied after add).
  - Help/usage output documents the new option.
