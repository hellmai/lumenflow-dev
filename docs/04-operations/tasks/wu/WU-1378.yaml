description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 agent report showed agent did not know CLI commands existed after
  init. Problem: No easy way to discover available commands without reading docs. Solution: Add
  lumenflow commands that lists all available CLI commands grouped by category with brief
  descriptions.'
acceptance:
  - New `lumenflow commands` subcommand exists and appears in CLI help.
  - Commands are grouped by category in the output.
  - Each command entry includes a short description.
  - Output includes a hint to run `<command> --help` for details.
