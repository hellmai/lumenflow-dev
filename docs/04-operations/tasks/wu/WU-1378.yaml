description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 agent report showed agent did not know CLI commands existed after init. Problem: No easy way to discover available commands without reading docs. Solution: Add lumenflow commands that lists all available CLI commands grouped by category with brief descriptions.'
acceptance:
  - New command lumenflow-commands exists
  - Commands grouped by category in output
  - Each command shows brief description
  - Output includes help hint for details
