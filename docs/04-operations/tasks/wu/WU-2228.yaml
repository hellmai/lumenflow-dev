description: 'Two issues: (1) pnpm lumenflow:commands is not mentioned anywhere in agent onboarding
  docs. Agents conclude commands dont exist instead of discovering them. (2) wu:escalate was added
  to CLAUDE.md and quick-ref-commands.md but NOT to starting-prompt.md, breaking parity.'
acceptance:
  - starting-prompt.md includes pnpm lumenflow:commands as mandatory command discovery step
  - starting-prompt.md includes wu:escalate in the WU lifecycle command table
  - quick-ref-commands.md includes pnpm lumenflow:commands prominently at the top
  - All onboarding docs have parity with CLAUDE.md for new commands
