description: 'Context: Haven 2.8.0 agent report showed confusion about which files agents can edit vs which are Lumenflow-managed. Problem: No clear documentation of file ownership boundaries. Solution: Add File Ownership section to LUMENFLOW.md template showing managed vs user-owned files.'
acceptance:
  - LUMENFLOW.md template has File Ownership section
  - Section lists Lumenflow-managed files with CLI commands
  - Section lists user-owned files that can be edited freely
  - Section is near top of document for visibility
