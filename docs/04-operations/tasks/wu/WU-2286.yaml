description: 'Context: state:emit appends corrective events but leaves main dirty, and claim flows then fail until operators manually commit under branch and hook constraints. Problem: recovery guidance often requires corrective events, yet the operational path can deadlock in strict repos where raw git on main is blocked. Solution: add an optional transactional commit mode for state:emit that uses micro-worktree/push-only workflow to persist corrective events with compliant commit messaging and audit metadata, avoiding manual git steps.'
acceptance:
  - state:emit supports an explicit transactional mode that commits corrective event changes via micro-worktree
  - transactional mode succeeds without leaving local main dirty
  - commit message and audit trail comply with main-branch policy hooks
  - existing append-only mode remains available for repos that prefer manual commit
  - regression tests cover transactional and non-transactional state:emit flows
  - pnpm gates passes
