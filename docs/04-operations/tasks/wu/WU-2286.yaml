notes: 'Added explicit --transactional mode to state:emit using micro-worktree push-only flow

description: 'Context: state:emit appends corrective events but leaves main dirty, and claim flows
  then fail until operators manually commit under branch and hook constraints. Problem: recovery
  guidance often requires corrective events, yet the operational path can deadlock in strict repos
  where raw git on main is blocked. Solution: add an optional transactional commit mode for
  state:emit that uses micro-worktree/push-only workflow to persist corrective events with compliant
  commit messaging and audit metadata, avoiding manual git steps.'
acceptance:
  - state:emit supports an explicit transactional mode that commits corrective event changes via
    micro-worktree
  - transactional mode succeeds without leaving local main dirty
  - commit message and audit trail comply with main-branch policy hooks
  - existing append-only mode remains available for repos that prefer manual commit
  - regression tests cover transactional and non-transactional state:emit flows
  - pnpm gates passes
