description: "Context: WU-1179 added rollback logic to handle push race conditions in multi-agent scenarios. Problem: pushWithRetry and pushWithRetryConfig call git reset --hard on the main checkout when push fails. This mutates the user's main checkout, can discard local changes, and causes file flashes in the IDE. This breaks the 'micro-worktree isolation' expectation - main should never be modified. Solution: Retry logic should never reset main; either use full micro-worktree isolation for rebase/retry or fail cleanly and let the agent retry."
acceptance:
  - Retry logic never calls reset --hard on the main checkout
  - When a push fails due to non-fast-forward, no files in main change
  - 'Retry path either: (a) uses micro-worktree isolation end-to-end, or (b) aborts with a clear retry error'
  - Unit tests updated to reflect new retry behavior (remove reset expectations from micro-worktree.test.ts line 221)
