description: "Two changes in one pass to the Medium article (medium-lumenflow-introduction.md): (1)
  Replace 'operating system' identity claims with 'agent orchestration layer' — keep OS as a simile
  only. (2) Apply Medium-optimisation research: cut to ~1,800 words, merge overlapping sections,
  move CTA earlier, add pull quotes, simplify vocabulary in key places."
acceptance:
  - "OS identity claims replaced: 'operating system' used only as simile (line 21), never as
    identity"
  - Subtitle updated from 'operating layer' to 'orchestration layer'
  - "Punchline (line 33) reframed: 'agent orchestration layer' not 'operating system'"
  - "Initiatives section: 'process groups / threads / CPU cores' paragraph removed"
  - Article cut to ~1,800 words (from 3,139) — target 7-8 min read
  - Initiatives and Orchestrating Multiple Agents sections merged into one
  - DORA metrics folded into What the Numbers Mean section
  - CTA (npm install + GitHub link) appears right after core loop demo, not just at end
  - At least one pull quote added (blockquote for visual break)
  - Vocabulary simplified in 2-3 places (e.g. coordination primitive -> coordination signal)
  - Tone consistent with voice guide in linked plan
