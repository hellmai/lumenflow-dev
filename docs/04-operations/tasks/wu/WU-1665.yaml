      paths) and verify deterministic recovery outcomes.

description: 'Context: wu:done recovery currently spans multiple rollback mechanisms (transaction
  abort, snapshots, branch rollback, zombie recovery), increasing failure-path complexity and drift
  risk. Problem: overlapping recovery channels create inconsistent semantics and high maintenance
  burden. Solution: consolidate rollback/recovery around the state-machine model with a staged
  migration approach (default new path plus temporary legacy fallback) and comprehensive
  failure-mode coverage.'
acceptance:
  - Default rollback/recovery path uses state-machine-driven semantics with serialized snapshot
    restore capabilities.
  - Legacy recovery path remains available behind LUMENFLOW_LEGACY_ROLLBACK=1 environment flag
    during migration window.
  - Failure-mode tests demonstrate parity or improvement versus pre-migration behavior across
    previously flaky/zombie-prone paths.
  - Rollback/recovery responsibilities are centralized and documented; duplicate mechanism overlap
    is removed or deprecated.
