description: "Make wu:claim automatically set up worktree dependencies so agents never hit the 'CLI
  not built' bootstrap issue. After wu:claim, worktrees have symlinked node_modules. When agents try
  wu:done, CLI dist doesn't exist. Solution: wu:claim runs pnpm install in worktree after creation."
acceptance:
  - wu:claim runs pnpm install in worktree after creation
  - Progress indicator shown during install
  - wu:done works immediately after claim without manual setup
  - Option to skip with --skip-setup for fast claims
