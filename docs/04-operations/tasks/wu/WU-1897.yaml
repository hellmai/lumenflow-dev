notes: >-
  Sizing: Medium (expected 20-35 files, 50-100 tool calls). Strategy: Checkpoint-Resume. Split
  rationale: separates initiative/plan/setup/orchestration migration from memory-family commands in
  WU-1889.


  Adjusted scoped code_paths to actual migrated surfaces; initiative/parity tool modules not
  modified in this split.

description: Split from WU-1889. Migrate initiative, plan, setup, and orchestration command surfaces
  from fallback/stub execution to native software-delivery pack handlers with resolver wiring and
  parity coverage.
acceptance:
  - Initiative/plan/setup/orchestration command surfaces execute through software-delivery handlers
    in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for migrated initiative/plan/setup/orchestration commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated command families succeeds without CLI fallback in strict
    migration mode
