description: >-
  Context: These files have pre-existing lint errors (no-console, missing return types,
  sonarjs/no-os-command-from-path) that were discovered during WU-1255.

  Problem: Gates fail due to these pre-existing errors when any changes are made to these files.

  Solution: Add eslint-disable comments where appropriate (CLI tools require console output), add
  return types to functions, or refactor to satisfy sonarjs rules.
acceptance:
  - All lint errors in initiative-create.ts, initiative-edit.ts, and pre-push-hook.test.ts are
    resolved
  - Gates pass on these files
