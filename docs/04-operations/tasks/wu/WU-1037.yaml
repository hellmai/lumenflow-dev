description: 'Context: The repo docs are being consolidated under
  docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow and agent onboarding docs are moving under
  docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding. Problem: Starlight docs may still
  reference the old paths (docs/lumenflow or ai/onboarding) or lack links to the canonical framework
  docs, causing confusion for users of the published site. Solution: audit the Starlight content and
  update references/links to the canonical operations framework paths.'
acceptance:
  - Starlight content has no references to docs/lumenflow or ai/onboarding paths.
  - Links to the LumenFlow playbook and agent onboarding point at the canonical
    docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/** paths.
  - pnpm -C apps/docs build -> PASS
