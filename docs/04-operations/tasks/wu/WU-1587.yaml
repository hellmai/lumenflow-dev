description: 'Context: infrastructure utilities in core still hold strict debt across cleanup, invariants orchestration, and worktree plumbing. Problem: these modules are low-level dependencies where weak typing can cause broad regressions. Solution: remove strict errors in infrastructure modules with explicit contracts and robust null/unknown narrowing.'
acceptance:
  - Strict errors are removed from targeted infrastructure files
  - Infrastructure behavior remains stable under existing tests
  - No net increase in as any usage in touched core files
  - Core infrastructure-related tests pass
  - Core strict progress baseline reflects reduced debt for this wave
