description: |
  Create integration tests for memory layer commands: mem:checkpoint, mem:signal, mem:inbox.
  Tests should validate checkpoint persistence, signal broadcasting, and inbox retrieval
  with proper filtering by time and WU.
acceptance:
  - Integration test for mem:checkpoint saves and retrieves state
  - Integration test for mem:signal broadcasts to inbox
  - Integration test for mem:inbox filters by --since and --wu
  - Tests validate signal ordering and deduplication
