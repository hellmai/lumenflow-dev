    - rg -n '\.lumenflow|docs/04-operations' packages/@lumenflow/core/src and confirm only allowed
      constants/test files contain literals

notes: Keep this core-only to avoid another repo-wide churn like WU-1428. Focus on centralizing
  literals and adding a guard, not rewriting every package.

description: 'Context: LumenFlow->LumenFlow rename caused wide churn because core code hardcoded path
  strings. Problem: .lumenflow and docs/04-operations literals are scattered across @lumenflow/core,
  making renames costly and error-prone. Solution: centralize these literals in core path constants
  and update core package to use them; add a regression guard to prevent reintroducing literals in
  core only (no repo-wide sweep).'
acceptance:
  - In @lumenflow/core, .lumenflow path references use centralized constants (no raw '.lumenflow'
    literals in core source outside the constants module and tests)
  - In @lumenflow/core, docs/04-operations references use config/WU_PATHS constants (no raw
    'docs/04-operations' literals in core source outside the constants module and tests)
  - Regex/glob builders in core compose from constants where touched in this WU
  - Regression guard in path-centralization test fails if new .lumenflow or docs/04-operations
    literals appear in core source
  - Scope is core-only; no repo-wide sweep
