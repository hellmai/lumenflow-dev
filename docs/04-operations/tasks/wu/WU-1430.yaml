description: "Context: The beacon→lumenflow migration required touching 50+ files because paths were hardcoded everywhere instead of using constants. Problem: Hardcoded strings like '.lumenflow', 'docs/04-operations', path patterns in regex, etc. are scattered across the codebase. Solution: Audit for hardcoded path strings, centralize them in wu-constants.ts or appropriate config, ensure future renames are one-line changes."
acceptance:
  - All .lumenflow path references use LUMENFLOW_PATHS constants
  - All docs/04-operations path references use config.directories constants
  - Regex patterns build from constants, not hardcoded strings
  - Lint rule or test prevents new hardcoded path strings
