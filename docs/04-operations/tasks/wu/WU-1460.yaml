description: >-
  Context: linking many WUs with initiative:add-wu causes repeated push-only writes to origin/main.

  Problem: high contention leads to retry exhaustion and operational overhead.

  Solution: support repeatable --wu arguments and process all links in one micro-worktree
  transaction.
acceptance:
  - initiative:add-wu accepts repeatable --wu flags
  - all provided WU links are applied atomically in one micro-worktree commit
  - existing single-WU behavior remains backward-compatible
  - tests cover batching, idempotency, and conflict validation
