title: Ensure worktree gates can locate CLI dist
lane: 'Framework: CLI'
type: feature
status: ready
priority: P2
created: 2026-01-20
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/gates.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-done.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-claim.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/__tests__/gates-worktree.test.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Create a new worktree
    - delete packages/@lumenflow/cli/dist
    - run pnpm gates and pnpm wu:done to confirm no MODULE_NOT_FOUND.

description: 'Context: Worktree gates fail when packages/@lumenflow/cli/dist is missing, causing
  wu:done to abort even for docs-only changes. Problem: worktrees often lack built CLI dist, and
  gates/wu:done resolve the CLI entrypoint from the worktree path, leading to MODULE_NOT_FOUND.
  Solution: make gates robust in worktrees by ensuring CLI dist is available (auto-build or fallback
  to main dist) before running gates.'
acceptance:
  - Running pnpm gates in a fresh worktree without CLI dist succeeds (auto-build or fallback).
  - pnpm wu:done succeeds in a worktree without manual CLI dist build.
  - Existing gates behavior on main remains unchanged.
