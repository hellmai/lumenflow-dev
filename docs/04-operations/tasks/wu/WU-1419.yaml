description: "Context: wu:recover --action reset updates WU YAML status to ready but doesn't emit a
  release event to the state store. Problem: State store still thinks WU is in_progress, blocking
  re-claim. Solution: Emit release event when resetting WU status."
acceptance:
  - wu:recover --action reset emits release event to state store
  - State store transitions WU from in_progress to ready on release event
  - Re-claiming a reset WU succeeds
