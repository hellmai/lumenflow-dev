description: npx lumenflow init fails with 404 because only @lumenflow/cli exists on npm. The Medium launch article tells users to run npx lumenflow init. Need a bare 'lumenflow' wrapper package that re-exports the CLI bins so npx resolution works.
acceptance:
  - npx lumenflow init resolves and delegates to @lumenflow/cli
  - Package is minimal wrapper with @lumenflow/cli as dependency
