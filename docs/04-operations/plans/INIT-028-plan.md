# INIT-028 Plan - Spawn-to-Delegation Clean-Slate Rename

## Goal

Complete a clean-slate rename from `spawn` terminology to `delegation` terminology across live runtime surfaces.

No compatibility aliases or dual-read bridges will be kept. Legacy state transitions via first-run auto-archive plus rebootstrap.
