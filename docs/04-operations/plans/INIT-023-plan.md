# INIT-023 Plan - LumenFlow Cloud Branch-PR Lifecycle Completion

Created: 2026-02-12

## Goal

Enable complete cloud/branch-pr lifecycle support in LumenFlow so cloud agents can execute:
- `wu:create --cloud`
- `wu:claim --cloud`
- `wu:prep`
- `wu:done`
- `wu:cleanup`

All from feature branches with PR-based completion, while preserving existing local worktree behavior.
