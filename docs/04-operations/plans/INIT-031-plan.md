# INIT-031 Plan - UX Surfaces — Web Dashboard, Pack DX, AG-UI, Marketplace

Created: 2026-02-18

## Goal

Make LumenFlow visible and exciting. Build user-facing surfaces on top of the kernel runtime (INIT-029) and runtime adoption (INIT-030) so two personas can interact with LumenFlow: (1) software devs using the software delivery pack who want to watch agents work and trust the automation, (2) pack authors and consumers who want to teach their AI new domains by adding packs. Capture displaced OpenClaw community with governance-first alternative.

## Scope

In scope: HTTP surface in surfaces package, Next.js web app (apps/web/), AG-UI protocol adapter, EventStore subscribe mechanism, pack CLI commands (scaffold/validate/hash/install/publish/search), git and registry pack resolution in PackLoader, pack authoring documentation, pack marketplace web page, CopilotKit integration example, GenUI tool renderers, policy decision overlay, human-in-the-loop approval UI, control plane event forwarding, community landing page. Out of scope: mobile apps, voice integration, non-MCP agent runtimes, changes to kernel runtime API.
