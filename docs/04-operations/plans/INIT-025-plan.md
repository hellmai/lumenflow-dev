# INIT-025 Plan - God File Decomposition Initiative

Created: 2026-02-12

## Goal

Decompose the 10 largest god files (1400-4100 lines each) into focused modules under 800 lines, with architectural restructuring where needed (not just mechanical splits). Priority target: the wu:done pipeline (3090+1568 lines across orchestrator and worktree module), which has accumulated 100+ patch references and 4 emergency fixes, causing ongoing stability churn.
