**Scope intersection** is the permission model at the heart of LumenFlow's security. Before any tool executes, the [kernel](/kernel/runtime) computes the intersection of four independent scope layers. A tool can only operate within the permissions that _all four layers jointly permit_.

## The Four Layers

| Layer         | Source                                     | Who controls it         | Example                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace** | `workspace.yaml` `security.allowed_scopes` | Workspace administrator | `src/**` (read+write), no network      |
| **Lane**      | Lane configuration `allowed_scopes`        | Lane owner              | `src/core/**` (write), `**` (read)     |
| **Task**      | Task spec `declared_scopes`                | Task author             | `src/core/auth/**` (write)             |
| **Tool**      | Pack manifest `required_scopes`            | Pack author             | `**` (write) — tool needs write access |

The intersection narrows progressively:

```
Workspace allows: src/** (write)
Lane allows:      src/core/** (write)
Task declares:    src/core/auth/** (write)
Tool requires:    ** (write)

Intersection: src/core/auth/** (write)
  ← narrowest pattern that all four agree on
```

The tool can only write to `src/core/auth/**`. Even though the tool itself requests `**` (everything), the workspace, lane, and task scopes constrain it.

## How Intersection Works

For each scope type (path-read, path-write, network), the kernel:

1. Takes every possible combination across the four layers
2. Checks that all four patterns overlap (using `micromatch` as the matching library)
3. Selects the **narrowest** pattern by specificity score (literal characters minus wildcard penalties)
4. Deduplicates results by `access:pattern` key

If any layer provides zero scopes for a given access type, the result for that access type is empty — which means denial.

### Empty intersection = denial

```
Workspace allows: src/** (write)
Lane allows:      tests/** (write)       ← no overlap with workspace
Task declares:    src/core/** (write)
Tool requires:    ** (write)

Intersection: [] (empty)
  → SCOPE_DENIED
```

The workspace and lane have no overlapping write patterns, so the intersection is empty and the tool call is denied.

## Scope Types

LumenFlow supports two scope types:

### Path scopes

```yaml
required_scopes:
  - type: path
    pattern: 'src/**'
    access: read # or 'write'
```

Path patterns use glob syntax (`*` for single segment, `**` for any depth). The kernel uses `micromatch` for pattern matching and a synthetic-path heuristic for containment checking.

### Network scopes

```yaml
required_scopes:
  - type: network
    posture: full # or 'off'
```

Network scopes use a simpler model — the `posture` value must match across all four layers. If the workspace says `off` and the tool says `full`, the intersection fails.

## Reserved Path Protection

Regardless of what scopes are configured, the kernel **unconditionally denies** writes to `.lumenflow/**`. This protects the kernel's own state (event log, evidence store, task specs) from being modified by any tool, even if all four scope layers would otherwise allow it.

This check runs _before_ scope intersection — it cannot be overridden by any configuration.

## Security Properties

The 4-level model provides several guarantees:

1. **Principle of least privilege.** Each layer narrows permissions. A broad tool scope is constrained by a narrow task scope.
2. **No privilege escalation.** A lower layer cannot grant permissions that a higher layer denied. The intersection can only shrink, never grow.
3. **Fail-closed.** Empty intersection = denied. Missing scopes at any layer = denied. The safe direction is always denial.
4. **Defense in depth.** Even if one layer is misconfigured (e.g., `**` for everything), the other three layers still constrain the effective scope.

<Aside type="note">
The scope intersection uses a synthetic-path heuristic for glob containment checking. Known approximations (brace expansion `{a,b}` and character classes `[abc]`) may produce false negatives but never false positives — the safe direction for security. This was verified by property-based fuzz testing with 10,000+ iterations using `micromatch` as the oracle.

## Example: Multi-Lane Workspace

Consider a workspace with two lanes and a tool that writes files:

```yaml
# workspace.yaml
security:
  allowed_scopes:
    - type: path
      pattern: '**'
      access: write

# Lane: Framework Core
allowed_scopes:
  - type: path
    pattern: 'src/core/**'
    access: write

# Lane: Experience UI
allowed_scopes:
  - type: path
    pattern: 'src/components/**'
    access: write
```

An agent working in the "Framework Core" lane on a task scoped to `src/core/auth/**` can write to `src/core/auth/**` — but cannot touch `src/components/` (lane boundary) or `docs/` (task boundary), even though the workspace allows `**`.
