This guide helps AI agents get productive with LumenFlow quickly, covering common mistakes and essential safety practices.

## Quick Start Checklist

Before starting any WU:

- [ ] Read the full WU spec (not just the title)
- [ ] Understand all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Claim the WU with `pnpm wu:claim`
- [ ] cd to the worktree IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] Work only in the worktree
- [ ] Stay within `code_paths`
- [ ] Follow TDD (failing test first)
- [ ] Run wu:prep before wu:done
- [ ] ALWAYS run wu:done

## The Most Common Mistake

<Card title="Not Running wu:done" icon="warning">
  The single most common mistake agents make is completing work, then stopping without running `pnpm
  wu:done`. This leaves the WU incomplete.
</Card>

### Why This Happens

1. **Confusion about scope** - Agent thinks completion is a "next step" for humans
2. **Fear of overstepping** - Agent hesitates to take "final" actions
3. **Token limits** - Agent runs out of context and summarizes remaining steps
4. **Missing context** - Agent doesn't realize wu:done should run immediately

### The Fix

After `wu:prep` passes, you MUST run:

```bash
cd /path/to/main
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX
```

Do NOT:

- Ask "Should I run wu:done?"
- Write "To Complete: pnpm wu:done"
- Wait for permission
- Treat it as a "future step"

### Correct Flow

```bash
# 1. In worktree, run gates via wu:prep
pnpm wu:prep --id WU-XXX

# 2. If wu:prep passes, return to main
cd /path/to/main

# 3. IMMEDIATELY run wu:done
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX

# 4. Report success with the wu:done output
```

## Top 10 First WU Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Using Worktrees

**Wrong:**

```bash
# Working directly in main
vim src/feature.ts
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
git push origin main
```

**Right:**

```bash
# Claim first, then work in worktree
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-123 --lane Core
cd worktrees/core-wu-123
vim src/feature.ts
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
git push origin lane/core/wu-123
cd /path/to/main
pnpm wu:done --id WU-123
```

### Mistake 2: Working Outside code_paths

The WU says `code_paths: [src/api/**]` but you edit `src/ui/component.ts`.

**Fix:** Only edit files within the specified `code_paths`. If you need other files, that's a different WU.

### Mistake 3: Skipping TDD

**Wrong:**

```
1. Write the feature
2. Maybe write tests later
3. Tests are hard, skip them
```

**Right:**

```
1. Write failing test
2. Run test (confirm RED)
3. Write minimum code
4. Run test (confirm GREEN)
5. Refactor if needed
```

### Mistake 4: Using Forbidden Git Commands

**Wrong:**

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
git push --force
git commit --no-verify
```

**Right:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin lane/core/wu-123
```

### Mistake 5: Scope Creep

The WU says "Add user profile endpoint" but you also:

- Refactor the database schema
- Add email notifications
- Redesign the UI

**Fix:** Implement exactly what the acceptance criteria specify. Create new WUs for other changes.

### Mistake 6: Not Reading the WU Spec

**Wrong:** Start coding immediately based on the title.

**Right:**

<Steps>

1. Read the full WU YAML
2. Understand acceptance criteria
3. Review code_paths
4. Check dependencies
5. Then start

</Steps>

### Mistake 7: Editing Main After Claim

**Wrong:**

```bash
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-123 --lane Core
# Still in main directory
vim src/feature.ts  # WRONG!
```

**Right:**

```bash
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-123 --lane Core
cd worktrees/core-wu-123  # IMMEDIATELY
vim src/feature.ts  # Now it's safe
```

### Mistake 8: Ignoring Gate Failures

**Wrong:**

```
Gates failed but I think the code is fine.
Let me use --skip-gates.
```

**Right:**

```
Gates failed. Let me read the error:
- TypeScript error in src/api/handler.ts
- Missing return type

Fix: Add the return type.
Re-run: pnpm wu:prep --id WU-123
```

### Mistake 9: Working After Hours Without Committing

If you need to pause:

```bash
# Commit your work
git add .
git commit -m "wip: partial progress"
git push origin lane/core/wu-123
```

Do NOT leave uncommitted changes in the worktree.

### Mistake 10: Using Absolute Paths

**Wrong:**

```typescript
// Using absolute paths bypasses worktree isolation
Write({
  file_path: '$HOME/project/src/feature.ts', // WRONG!
  content: '...',
});
```

**Right:**

```typescript
// Relative paths respect worktree context
Write({
  file_path: 'src/feature.ts', // Correct
  content: '...',
});
```

## Universal Safety Mechanisms

LumenFlow enforces safety at the repository level, protecting all agents (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and humans.

### Git Safety Wrapper

Use `scripts/safe-git` instead of system `git` to block destructive operations:

```bash
# Use the safe wrapper
./scripts/safe-git status
./scripts/safe-git commit -m "feat: add feature"

# These are blocked automatically:
./scripts/safe-git worktree remove ...  # BLOCKED
./scripts/safe-git reset --hard         # BLOCKED
./scripts/safe-git clean -fd            # BLOCKED
./scripts/safe-git push --force         # BLOCKED
```

### Repository Hooks (Husky)

These run for **everyone** on every commit:

| Hook                   | What It Does                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secret scanning        | Blocks commits containing AWS/GitHub/OpenAI keys                          |
| Absolute path scanning | Blocks common home-dir absolute paths (use `~` or relative paths instead) |
| Lockfile sync          | Blocks dependency changes without lockfile update                         |
| Worktree discipline    | Blocks main commits when worktrees exist                                  |

### Audit Logs

All blocked actions are logged for visibility:

- `.lumenflow/safety-blocks.log` – Blocked safety violations
- `.lumenflow/force-bypasses.log` – Emergency LUMENFLOW_FORCE bypasses

<Aside type="tip">
  These mechanisms work regardless of which AI agent or IDE you use. They're enforced at the
  git/hook level, not the agent level.

### Stop and Ask When

| Trigger                     | Action    |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| Same error repeats 3 times  | Stop, ask |
| Auth or permissions changes | Stop, ask |
| PII/secrets involved        | Stop, ask |
| Cloud spend decisions       | Stop, ask |
| Policy changes required     | Stop, ask |
| Anything feels irreversible | Stop, ask |

### Never Do

| Action                   | Why               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `git reset --hard`       | Data loss risk    |
| `git push --force`       | History rewrite   |
| `--no-verify`            | Bypasses safety   |
| `git stash` (on main)    | Hides work        |
| `git clean -fd`          | Deletes files     |
| Work in main after claim | Breaks isolation  |
| Skip wu:done             | Incomplete WU     |
| Use absolute paths       | Bypasses worktree |

### Always Do

| Action                     | Why              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Read WU spec first         | Understand scope |
| cd to worktree after claim | Isolation        |
| Write tests before code    | TDD              |
| Run wu:prep before wu:done | Quality          |
| Run wu:done                | Complete WU      |
| Stay within code_paths     | Scope discipline |
| Use relative paths         | Respect worktree |
| Verify pwd before file ops | Avoid path trap  |

### Error Handling

**Max 3 Attempts Rule:**

If the same error happens 3 times:

1. Stop trying
2. Document what happened
3. Ask for help

**Gate Failures:**

1. Read the error message
2. Fix the underlying issue
3. Re-run `wu:prep`
4. Never use `--skip-gates` for new failures

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check lane availability
cat docs/04-operations/tasks/status.md

# Claim a WU
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-XXX --lane <Lane>

# Work in worktree
cd worktrees/<lane>-wu-xxx

# Run gates in worktree
pnpm wu:prep --id WU-XXX          # Code changes
pnpm wu:prep --id WU-XXX --docs-only  # Docs changes

# Complete WU
cd /path/to/main
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX
```

### When Uncertain

Choose the safer path:

- Don't modify files outside code_paths
- Don't bypass hooks
- Don't skip gates
- Ask rather than assume

## Completion Checklist

Before ending any session, verify:

- [ ] Did I run `pnpm wu:prep --id WU-XXX` in the worktree?
- [ ] Did wu:prep pass?
- [ ] Did I `cd` back to main?
- [ ] Did I run `pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX`?
- [ ] Did wu:done complete successfully?

If any answer is "no", you're not done yet.

## Symptoms of Incomplete WU

If wu:done wasn't run, you'll see:

- Worktree still exists: `ls worktrees/`
- No stamp: `ls .lumenflow/stamps/WU-XXX.done` returns nothing
- Status unchanged: WU still shows as `in_progress`
- Branch not merged: Changes only on lane branch

## Recovery

If a previous session forgot to run wu:done:

```bash
# 1. Check worktree exists
ls worktrees/

# 2. If it does, run wu:done
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX

# 3. If worktree was deleted but branch exists
# This is a bad state - may need manual recovery
pnpm wu:recover --id WU-XXX
```

## What wu:done Does

When you run `pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX` (after a successful `wu:prep`):

1. Validates the worktree exists and has commits
2. Fast-forward merges to main
3. Creates the done stamp
4. Updates status and backlog docs
5. Removes the worktree
6. Pushes to origin

This is the ONLY way to complete a WU. Manual steps leave things inconsistent.

## Emergency Override (LUMENFLOW_FORCE)

<Aside type="caution">
  Emergency override bypasses safety mechanisms. AI agents MUST get explicit user approval before
  using LUMENFLOW_FORCE. All bypasses are logged to `.lumenflow/force-bypasses.log`.
</Aside>

### When Override is Appropriate

- Fixing YAML parsing bugs in WU specs
- Emergency production hotfixes (with user present)
- Recovering from corrupted workflow state
- Bootstrap operations when CLI not yet built

### When NOT to Use Override

- Skipping failing tests
- Avoiding code review
- Working around gate failures
- Convenience or speed

### How to Use

<Steps>

1. **Get user approval** - Stop and ask before using LUMENFLOW_FORCE
2. **Execute with audit trail** - Use `LUMENFLOW_FORCE_REASON` and `LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1` (see example below)
3. **Document** - Add a note to WU YAML explaining the bypass

</Steps>

```bash
LUMENFLOW_FORCE_REASON="user-approved: <reason>" LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git <command>
```

### Examples

```bash
# Bypass safe-git for reset --hard
LUMENFLOW_FORCE_REASON="user-approved: recovering corrupted state" LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git reset --hard HEAD

# Bypass hook for commit with false positive
LUMENFLOW_FORCE_REASON="user-approved: false positive secret detection" LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 git commit -m "fix: update config"
```

### Audit Log Format

All bypasses are logged:

```
ISO_TIMESTAMP|BYPASSED|COMMAND_OR_HOOK|USER|BRANCH|REASON|CWD
```

<Aside type="note">
  If LUMENFLOW_FORCE is used without LUMENFLOW_FORCE_REASON, "NO_REASON" is logged and a warning is
  printed. The command still proceeds.
</Aside>

## Setup and Verification

### Claude Code

Claude Code automatically respects LumenFlow safety through:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Entry point referencing safety rules
- **.claude/skills/** - Skills include safety context
- **.claude/agents/** - Agent definitions include constraints

No additional setup required.

### Cursor

Cursor uses `.cursor/rules/lumenflow.md` for safety rules.

```bash
# Initialize with Cursor overlay
lumenflow init --client cursor
```

**Verify:** Ask Cursor AI "What are the LumenFlow safety rules?" - it should mention worktree discipline, forbidden git commands, and LUMENFLOW_FORCE.

### Windsurf

Windsurf uses `.windsurf/rules/lumenflow.md` for safety rules.

```bash
# Initialize with Windsurf overlay
lumenflow init --client windsurf
```

**Verify:** Ask in Cascade "What safety mechanisms does this project use?" - it should mention safe-git wrapper, Husky hooks, and audit logs.

### Manual Verification

Test that safety mechanisms work:

```bash
# Verify safe-git blocks dangerous commands
./scripts/safe-git reset --hard HEAD
# Should show: === LUMENFLOW SAFETY BLOCK ===

# Verify hooks are installed
ls -la .husky/

# Verify bypass works with audit
LUMENFLOW_FORCE_REASON="testing" LUMENFLOW_FORCE=1 ./scripts/safe-git --version
# Should succeed and log to .lumenflow/force-bypasses.log
```
