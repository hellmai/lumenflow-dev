LumenFlow treats AI agents as first-class collaborators. This guide covers how to work effectively with AI assistants.

## AI as Teammate

LumenFlow is designed for AI agents to:

- Understand work context (WU specs)
- Execute autonomously (clear acceptance)
- Prove completion (gates + stamps)
- Recover context (memory layer)

## Agent Onboarding

Provide agents with:

<Steps>

1. **WU Spec** – The work to be done
2. **Acceptance Criteria** – Definition of done
3. **Code Paths** – Where to work
4. **Memory Context** – What happened before

</Steps>

### Prompt Template

```markdown
## Context

You are working on WU-042 in the LumenFlow workflow.

## Work Unit

- ID: WU-042
- Title: Add email validation to login form
- Lane: UI
- Status: in_progress

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Email field validates on blur
2. Invalid emails show "Please enter a valid email"
3. Valid emails allow form submission
4. Unit test covers validation logic

## Code Paths

- src/components/LoginForm.tsx
- src/utils/validation.ts

## Instructions

1. Work in worktree: worktrees/ui-wu-042
2. Implement changes per acceptance
3. Run: pnpm gates
4. When done: pnpm wu:done --id WU-042
```

## Memory Integration

For long-running agent sessions:

```bash
# Agent starts session
pnpm mem:start --wu WU-042

# Agent signals progress
pnpm mem:signal "Validation logic complete"

# Agent creates checkpoint (before pause/context limit)
pnpm mem:checkpoint

# Agent resumes later
pnpm mem:ready
# → Shows previous progress
```

## Context Recovery

When an agent session ends and a new one begins:

```bash
# New agent runs
pnpm mem:ready

# Output:
# WU-042 in progress
# Last signal: "Validation logic complete"
# Files touched: src/utils/validation.ts
# Next: Add unit tests
```

The agent can continue where the previous session left off.

## Autonomous Execution

For trusted agents, enable autonomous mode:

```yaml
# WU spec
autonomous: true
approval_required: false
```

The agent can:

- Claim and complete without human approval
- Make decisions within scope
- Log decisions for audit

<Aside type="caution">
  Use autonomous mode only for well-scoped WUs with clear boundaries. Human oversight is still
  recommended for security-sensitive or customer-facing changes.
</Aside>

## Safety Guardrails

### Scope Limits

Define what agents can and cannot do:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
agent:
  allowed_paths:
    - src/**
    - tests/**
  forbidden_paths:
    - .env*
    - secrets/**
  max_file_changes: 10
```

### Approval Gates

Require human approval for certain actions:

```yaml
agent:
  require_approval_for:
    - delete_files
    - modify_config
    - external_api_calls
```

### Escalation

Agents should escalate when:

- Acceptance criteria are unclear
- Security concerns arise
- Scope seems larger than WU

```bash
pnpm wu:escalate --id WU-042 --reason "Unclear: should validation be server-side too?"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When multiple agents work in parallel:

### Lane Isolation

Each agent works in a separate lane:

```
Agent A → Lane: UI → WU-100
Agent B → Lane: Core → WU-101
Agent C → Lane: Infra → WU-102
```

No conflicts, parallel progress.

### Dependency Handling

If WUs depend on each other:

```yaml
# WU-101
dependencies:
  - WU-100 # Agent B waits for Agent A
```

Agent B blocks until WU-100 is done.

## Agent Types

### Coding Agent

Implements code per WU spec:

- Writes code
- Writes tests
- Runs gates
- Completes WU

### Review Agent

Reviews completed WUs:

- Checks code quality
- Validates against acceptance
- Suggests improvements

### Discovery Agent

Explores and documents:

- Research spikes
- Architecture decisions
- Documentation updates

## Best Practices

### For Human-Agent Collaboration

1. **Clear WU specs** – Agents need explicit acceptance
2. **Small WUs** – Easier for agents to complete
3. **Frequent checkpoints** – Recover from context limits
4. **Review agent work** – Trust but verify

### For Fully Autonomous Agents

1. **Strict scope limits** – Prevent runaway changes
2. **Gate enforcement** – Quality checks are non-negotiable
3. **Audit trails** – Log all decisions and actions
4. **Kill switch** – Ability to pause/stop agent work
