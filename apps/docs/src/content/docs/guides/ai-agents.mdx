LumenFlow treats AI agents as first-class collaborators. This guide covers how to work effectively with AI assistants.

<Aside type="tip" title="Works with Any AI">
  LumenFlow is **friction-free for any AI coding assistant**. If your AI can read project files, it can use LumenFlow—just point it at `AGENTS.md` and `LUMENFLOW.md`. No vendor lock-in, no special setup required.

Enhanced integrations for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline provide deeper features but are entirely optional.

</Aside>

## Integration Options

LumenFlow provides three ways for AI agents to interact with the workflow:

| Interface      | Best For                             | Setup                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **File-based** | Any AI that can read markdown        | Point AI at `AGENTS.md`          |
| **CLI**        | Terminal-based agents, scripts       | `pnpm wu:claim`, etc.            |
| **MCP**        | Programmatic access via MCP protocol | [Setup Guide](/guides/mcp-setup) |

The MCP server (`@lumenflow/mcp`) exposes workflow tools and resources over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling AI assistants to interact with LumenFlow programmatically. See the [MCP Reference](/reference/mcp) for available tools.

## AI as Teammate

LumenFlow is designed for AI agents to:

- Understand work context (WU specs)
- Execute autonomously (clear acceptance)
- Prove completion (gates + stamps)
- Recover context (memory layer)

## Agent Onboarding

Provide agents with:

<Steps>

1. **WU Spec** – The work to be done
2. **Acceptance Criteria** – Definition of done
3. **Code Paths** – Where to work
4. **Memory Context** – What happened before

</Steps>

### Prompt Template

```markdown
## Context

You are working on WU-042 in the LumenFlow workflow.

## Work Unit

- ID: WU-042
- Title: Add email validation to login form
- Lane: UI
- Status: in_progress

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Email field validates on blur
2. Invalid emails show "Please enter a valid email"
3. Valid emails allow form submission
4. Unit test covers validation logic

## Code Paths

- src/components/LoginForm.tsx
- src/utils/validation.ts

## Instructions

1. Work in worktree: worktrees/ui-wu-042
2. Implement changes per acceptance
3. Run: pnpm wu:prep --id WU-042
4. From main: pnpm wu:done --id WU-042
```

## Memory Integration

For long-running agent sessions:

```bash
# Agent starts session
pnpm mem:start --wu WU-042

# Agent signals progress
pnpm mem:signal "Validation logic complete" --wu WU-042

# Agent creates checkpoint (before pause/context limit)
pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-042

# Agent resumes later
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-042
# → Shows previous progress
```

## Context Recovery

When an agent session ends and a new one begins:

```bash
# New agent runs
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-042

# Output:
# WU-042 in progress
# Last signal: "Validation logic complete"
# Files touched: src/utils/validation.ts
# Next: Add unit tests
```

The agent can continue where the previous session left off.

## Autonomous Execution

For trusted agents, enable autonomous mode:

```yaml
# WU spec
autonomous: true
approval_required: false
```

The agent can:

- Claim and complete without human approval
- Make decisions within scope
- Log decisions for audit

<Aside type="caution">
  Use autonomous mode only for well-scoped WUs with clear boundaries. Human oversight is still
  recommended for security-sensitive or customer-facing changes.
</Aside>

## Safety Guardrails

LumenFlow provides multiple layers of safety for AI agents.

### Universal Safety (Repository-Level)

These protections work for **all agents** regardless of IDE or AI provider:

**Git Safety Wrapper** (`scripts/safe-git`):

```bash
# Blocks dangerous operations automatically
./scripts/safe-git worktree remove ...  # BLOCKED
./scripts/safe-git reset --hard         # BLOCKED
./scripts/safe-git clean -fd            # BLOCKED
./scripts/safe-git push --force         # BLOCKED
```

**Husky Pre-Commit Hooks**:

- Secret scanning (AWS/GitHub/OpenAI keys)
- Absolute path scanning (common home-dir absolute paths; prefer `~` or relative paths)
- Lockfile sync validation
- Worktree discipline enforcement

**Audit Logs**:

- `.lumenflow/safety-blocks.log` – Blocked operations
- `.lumenflow/force-bypasses.log` – Emergency bypasses

<Aside type="tip">
  Configure agents to use `scripts/safe-git` as their git command for maximum protection.
</Aside>

### Scope Limits

Define what agents can and cannot do:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
agent:
  allowed_paths:
    - src/**
    - tests/**
  forbidden_paths:
    - .env*
    - secrets/**
  max_file_changes: 10
```

### Approval Gates

Require human approval for certain actions:

```yaml
agent:
  require_approval_for:
    - delete_files
    - modify_config
    - external_api_calls
```

### Escalation

Agents should escalate when:

- Acceptance criteria are unclear
- Security concerns arise
- Scope seems larger than WU

```bash
pnpm wu:block --id WU-042 --reason "Unclear: should validation be server-side too?"
```

## Cloud Agent Branches

Cloud-hosted agents (like Prompt Studio, GitHub Actions, or custom automation) that create their own branches can bypass worktree requirements.

### Configuration

Add patterns to your config to allow specific branch prefixes:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
git:
  mainBranch: main
  agentBranchPatterns:
    - 'agent/*' # Default: agent-created branches
    - 'claude/*' # Optional: Claude-specific branches
    - 'automation/*' # Optional: CI/CD automation
```

### How It Works

When a branch matches an `agentBranchPatterns` glob:

- **Worktree requirement bypassed** – Agent can work in main checkout
- **Git shim allows destructive commands** – Agent manages its own isolation
- **Write/Edit hooks allow file changes** – No worktree check enforced

<Aside type="caution">
  Protected branches (`mainBranch` and `master`) are **never** bypassed, even if they match a
  pattern. Lane branches (`lane/*`) also require worktrees regardless of patterns.
</Aside>

### Headless Mode for CI/CD

For pipelines that don't use branch patterns, enable guarded headless mode:

```bash
# Requires one guard to prevent accidental local use
export LUMENFLOW_HEADLESS=1
export CI=true  # or LUMENFLOW_ADMIN=1 or GITHUB_ACTIONS=true
```

This bypasses worktree checks for automation that manages its own isolation.

### Detection Priority

The system evaluates in this order (first match wins):

1. Headless mode (if guarded) → bypass
2. Detached HEAD → protected (fail-closed)
3. Agent branch pattern match → bypass
4. Protected branch → protected
5. Lane branch → protected (use worktree)
6. Unknown branch → protected (fail-closed)

<Aside>
  The **fail-closed** design means unknown branches are blocked when worktrees exist. This prevents
  accidental work in the wrong location.
</Aside>

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When multiple agents work in parallel:

### Lane Isolation

Each agent works in a separate lane:

```
Agent A → Lane: UI → WU-100
Agent B → Lane: Core → WU-101
Agent C → Lane: Infra → WU-102
```

No conflicts, parallel progress.

### Dependency Handling

If WUs depend on each other:

```yaml
# WU-101
dependencies:
  - WU-100 # Agent B waits for Agent A
```

Agent B blocks until WU-100 is done.

## Agent Types

### Coding Agent

Implements code per WU spec:

- Writes code
- Writes tests
- Runs gates
- Completes WU

### Review Agent

Reviews completed WUs:

- Checks code quality
- Validates against acceptance
- Suggests improvements

### Discovery Agent

Explores and documents:

- Research spikes
- Architecture decisions
- Documentation updates

## Best Practices

### For Human-Agent Collaboration

1. **Clear WU specs** – Agents need explicit acceptance
2. **Small WUs** – Easier for agents to complete
3. **Frequent checkpoints** – Recover from context limits
4. **Review agent work** – Trust but verify

### For Fully Autonomous Agents

1. **Strict scope limits** – Prevent runaway changes
2. **Gate enforcement** – Quality checks are non-negotiable
3. **Audit trails** – Log all decisions and actions
4. **Kill switch** – Ability to pause/stop agent work

## Skills

LumenFlow supports **agent skills** — modular knowledge bundles that provide domain expertise and validation checklists. Skills are stored in `.claude/skills/` (for Claude Code) or `.lumenflow/skills/` (vendor-agnostic).

### Available Skills

### Loading Skills

Skills are loaded automatically by `wu:brief` based on WU context, or manually:

```bash
# Claude Code
/skill wu-lifecycle
/skill tdd-workflow

# View available skills
ls .claude/skills/
```

### Skill Structure

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description for skill selection
version: 1.0.0
source: path/to/canonical/source.md
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Grep
---
```

### Configuration

Skills per lane can be configured in `.lumenflow.config.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  clients:
    claude-code:
      skills:
        instructions: 'Load skills based on WU context:'
        recommended:
          - wu-lifecycle
          - worktree-discipline
        byLane:
          'Framework: Core':
            - tdd-workflow
            - lumenflow-gates
```

## Agents

Pre-configured agent definitions for Task tool orchestration live in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent                | Model | Purpose                          |
| -------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| `general-purpose`    | opus  | Standard WU implementation       |

| `bug-triage`         | haiku | Bug classification (P0-P3)       |
| `lumenflow-doc-sync` | haiku | Documentation synchronization    |

### Spawning Agents

Use `wu:brief` to generate Task tool invocations with proper context:

```bash
pnpm wu:brief --id WU-001 --client <client>
```
