LumenFlow is a **stack-agnostic** delivery methodology. The core concepts (Work Units, Lanes, Gates, Memory) apply regardless of whether you're building with Python, .NET, Node.js, Go, Rust, or any other language.

## Stack-Agnostic by Design

LumenFlow deliberately separates **methodology** from **implementation**:

- **Methodology**: WUs, lanes, gates, and flow states are universal concepts
- **Implementation**: Gate commands, tooling, and CI/CD adapt to your stack

This separation means:

1. Teams can adopt LumenFlow without changing their existing toolchain
2. Polyglot monorepos work naturally (different gates per package)
3. Migration to new languages doesn't require workflow changes

## How Language Support Works

LumenFlow adapts to your stack through **gate presets** and **configuration**:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
gates:
  execution:
    preset: 'python' # or 'dotnet', 'node', 'go', 'rust'
```

Each preset provides sensible defaults for:

| Gate      | Purpose                        | Language-specific tools       |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Format    | Code style consistency         | prettier, ruff, dotnet format |
| Lint      | Static analysis                | eslint, ruff, dotnet build    |
| Typecheck | Type safety (where applicable) | tsc, mypy, go vet             |
| Test      | Test execution                 | jest, pytest, dotnet test     |

## Coming Soon

More language guides are in development. Don’t wait for a guide—LumenFlow works with any language
today. Configure your gate commands manually or use auto-detection.

## Universal Workflow

Regardless of language, the workflow remains consistent:

```bash
# 1. Create a WU (same command, any language)
pnpm wu:create --title "Add user auth" --lane "Framework: Core" \
  --type feature --exposure api \
  --description "Add authentication flow" \
  --acceptance "Users can log in with email/password" \
  --code-paths "src/auth/" \
  --test-paths-unit "src/auth/__tests__/auth.test.ts" \
  --plan
# Use the generated ID from the output (example: WU-123)

# 2. Claim and work in isolated worktree
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-123 --lane "Framework: Core"
cd worktrees/framework-core-wu-123

# 3. Run gates in the worktree
pnpm wu:prep --id WU-123

# 4. Complete (from repo root)
cd /path/to/repo
pnpm wu:done --id WU-123
```

The gates command automatically detects your language and runs the appropriate tools. See [Configuration](/reference/config) for full customization options.
