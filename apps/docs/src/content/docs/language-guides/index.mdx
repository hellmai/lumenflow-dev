LumenFlow is a **stack-agnostic** delivery methodology. The core concepts (Work Units, Lanes, Gates, Memory) apply regardless of whether you're building with Python, .NET, Node.js, Go, Rust, or any other language.

## Stack-Agnostic by Design

LumenFlow deliberately separates **methodology** from **implementation**:

- **Methodology**: WUs, lanes, gates, and flow states are universal concepts
- **Implementation**: Gate commands, tooling, and CI/CD adapt to your stack

This separation means:

1. Teams can adopt LumenFlow without changing their existing toolchain
2. Polyglot monorepos work naturally (different gates per package)
3. Migration to new languages doesn't require workflow changes

## How Language Support Works

LumenFlow adapts to your stack through **gate presets** and **configuration**:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
gates:
  execution:
    preset: 'python'  # or 'dotnet', 'node', 'go', 'rust'
```

Each preset provides sensible defaults for:

| Gate      | Purpose                        | Language-specific tools       |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Format    | Code style consistency         | prettier, ruff, dotnet format |
| Lint      | Static analysis                | eslint, ruff, dotnet build    |
| Typecheck | Type safety (where applicable) | tsc, mypy, go vet             |
| Test      | Test execution                 | jest, pytest, dotnet test     |

  <Card title="Python" icon="python">
    Django, FastAPI, Flask, and more. Uses ruff for linting and pytest for testing.
    [Python Guide](/language-guides/python/)
  </Card>
  <Card title=".NET" icon="laptop">
    C#, F#, ASP.NET Core, and Blazor. Uses dotnet CLI for all gates.

## Coming Soon

Additional language guides are in development:

- **Go** - For microservices and CLI tools
- **Rust** - For systems programming and WebAssembly
- **Java** - For enterprise applications (Spring Boot, Quarkus)
- **Ruby** - For Rails and Sinatra applications
- **PHP** - For Laravel and Symfony applications

<Aside>
  Don't wait for a guide! LumenFlow works with any language today. Configure your gate commands
  manually or use auto-detection.

## Universal Workflow

Regardless of language, the workflow remains consistent:

```bash
# 1. Create a WU (same command, any language)
pnpm wu:create --id WU-001 --title "Add user auth" --lane "Framework: Core"

# 2. Claim and work in isolated worktree
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-001 --lane "Framework: Core"
cd worktrees/framework-core-wu-001

# 3. Run gates (language-specific commands execute)
pnpm gates

# 4. Complete (from repo root)
cd /path/to/repo
pnpm wu:done --id WU-001
```

The gates command automatically detects your language and runs the appropriate tools. See [Configuration](/reference/config) for full customization options.
