title: v2.3.2
description: Workflow alignment and tooling polish
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Highlights

- **Two-step completion**: `wu:prep` runs gates in the worktree, `wu:done` merges from main
- **CLI accuracy**: Command names and required flags aligned with current tooling
- **Docs alignment**: Updated examples to match the current completion flow

## Upgrade

```bash
pnpm lumenflow:upgrade --latest
```

<Aside type="tip">
  After upgrading, run `pnpm exec lumenflow docs:sync --force` to refresh agent onboarding docs.
