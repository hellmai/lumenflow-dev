## The Problem

AI agents write code, call APIs, and ship features. But nobody is watching them.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="No receipts" icon="warning">
    Your agent pushes to production. Six months later, compliance asks "Who approved this?" You
    check git blame, Slack, PR comments — nothing. The agent didn't leave a trail because nobody
    asked it to.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No guardrails" icon="error">
    You tell your agent "don't touch .env files." But that's a polite suggestion in a system prompt
    that nothing enforces. One hallucination later, your secrets are in a commit message.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No boundaries" icon="close">
    You ask the agent to fix a login bug. It fixes the bug, refactors the payment module, updates
    three unrelated tests, and adds a dependency you've never heard of. Nothing stopped it because
    nothing could.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

LumenFlow sits between your agents and everything they touch — a **governance kernel** that enforces rules before actions happen, not after.

---

## Four Guarantees

Structural properties of the kernel — enforced at runtime, every time, for every agent.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Agents stay in their lane" icon="approve-check">
    A 4-level scope intersection checks workspace, lane, task, and tool permissions before any
    action proceeds. All four levels must agree. One "no" and it's blocked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Every action has a receipt" icon="document">
    Immutable, content-addressed evidence records capture what was requested, what was checked, and
    what happened. Not logs — cryptographic proof that can be independently verified.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policies can't be loosened" icon="seti:lock">
    The deny-wins cascade means a restrictive policy at any level stays restrictive. A lane can't
    override a workspace rule. Strictness only goes one direction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation is real" icon="setting">
    Agents run in bwrap sandboxes with write confinement and deny overlays on secrets. OS-level
    isolation — enforced by the Linux kernel, not by the agent runtime.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Works With Any AI

No vendor lock-in. If your AI can read files and run commands, it can use LumenFlow. Point your agent at `AGENTS.md` and go.

| Any AI Tool                                         | Enhanced Integrations                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Works out of the box via markdown instructions      | Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex get deeper features |
| CLI commands work everywhere — no lock-in           | Auto-detection, skills, vendor-specific overlays         |
| Universal entry points: `AGENTS.md`, `LUMENFLOW.md` | Optional: `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/` configs   |

## Open Source by Design

**Free and open source** under a dual-license model built for trust:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="AGPL v3 — Kernel & Packs" icon="approve-check">
    The kernel, runtime, and all packs are AGPL v3. Modify LumenFlow and deploy it as a service? You
    share your changes. No proprietary forks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Apache 2.0 — SDK" icon="open-book">
    The Control Plane SDK is Apache 2.0 — use it in proprietary projects, commercial products, or
    closed-source integrations with zero AGPL obligations.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Every source file carries an SPDX license header. Every package has the correct license in `package.json`. A `NOTICE` file documents the full model. Governance software that isn't transparent about its own governance would be a bad joke.

## Extensible by Design

The kernel is domain-agnostic. Domain knowledge comes from **packs** — pluggable extensions that add tools, policies, and evidence types for any workflow.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Software Delivery Pack" icon="setting">
    **Ships built-in.** Work Units, lanes, gates, worktrees, memory, flow metrics, and 100+ CLI
    commands for structured software delivery. This is what we use to build LumenFlow itself.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Build Your Own" icon="add-document">
    Customer support, data pipelines, infrastructure, compliance — if you can define the rules, you
    can build a pack for it.
