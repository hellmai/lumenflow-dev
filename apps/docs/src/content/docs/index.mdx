## Why LumenFlow?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Clarity over chaos" icon="pencil">
    Every Work Unit has explicit acceptance criteria. No ambiguity about what "done" means.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-first design" icon="rocket">
    Built for AI agents to understand and execute. Clear specs, automated gates, context recovery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality by default" icon="approve-check">
    Gates (format, lint, typecheck, test) run automatically. No "works on my machine."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flow, not queues" icon="forward-slash">
    Lane-based WIP limits prevent overload. Finish work before starting new work.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Give your agent one link

<Aside type="tip" title="Copy this prompt">
Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Cline, or any AI coding assistant:

```text
Set up LumenFlow for this project: https://lumenflow.dev/getting-started/quickstart/
```

</Aside>

Your agent will install LumenFlow, create the first Work Unit, and stop — ready for you to review before implementation begins.
