  tagline: Your AI agents are powerful. Make them governable. An open-source runtime kernel that controls what agents can do, proves what they did, and enforces policies they can't bypass — without slowing them down.

## The Problem

AI agents can read files, write code, call APIs, and deploy services. But without governance, they operate in a trust vacuum.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="No audit trail" icon="warning">
    Your agent writes to production. Six months later, compliance asks "who approved this change?"
    You have no answer.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No policy enforcement" icon="error">
    Your agent instructions say "don't touch .env files." But instructions are suggestions — nothing
    actually stops the agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No scope boundaries" icon="close">
    Agent asked to fix a login bug modifies the payment module instead. No mechanism prevented it.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

LumenFlow solves this by inserting a **governance kernel** between agents and the world.

## Works With Any AI

LumenFlow is **friction-free for any AI coding assistant**. If your AI can read project files, it can use LumenFlow — just point it at `AGENTS.md`.

| Any AI Tool                                           | Enhanced Integrations                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Works out of the box with plain markdown instructions  | Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex get deeper features |
| No vendor lock-in — CLI commands work everywhere       | Auto-detection, skills, vendor-specific configs          |
| Universal entry points: `AGENTS.md`, `LUMENFLOW.md`   | Optional overlays: `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`  |

## Four Guarantees

The kernel provides four guarantees that **cannot be bypassed**:

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Agents can't go off-script" icon="approve-check">
    4-level scope intersection: workspace, lane, task, and tool permissions must all agree before
    execution proceeds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Every action is provable" icon="document">
    Immutable evidence receipts with content-addressed inputs. Cryptographic proof of what was
    requested, allowed, and enforced.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policies are inescapable" icon="warning">
    Deny-wins cascade evaluated at every tool call. A restrictive policy at any level cannot be
    loosened by a lower level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation is OS-enforced" icon="setting">
    bwrap sandbox with write confinement and deny overlays on secrets. Enforced by the OS, not by
    the agent runtime.
  </Card>

## Extensible by Design

Packs are domain plugins that teach the kernel new capabilities. Install a pack to add tools, policies, and evidence types for any domain.

## LumenFlow vs Alternatives

How does LumenFlow governance compare to other approaches?

| Aspect                   | Scrum / Kanban    | GitHub Actions alone | LangChain / CrewAI   | LumenFlow                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent governance**     | None              | CI-only              | Trust the prompt     | 4-level scope, deny-wins policy engine               |
| **Evidence of work**     | Ticket status     | Logs                 | None                 | Immutable evidence receipts                          |
| **Sandbox isolation**    | None              | Container-level      | None                 | OS-level bwrap with secret deny overlays             |
| **Work partitioning**    | Columns / sprints | Workflows            | Agent roles          | Lanes with WIP limits and worktree isolation         |
| **Context recovery**     | Human memory      | None                 | Conversation history | Checkpointed memory layer with auto-recovery         |
| **Quality gates**        | PR review         | CI checks            | None                 | Automated gates: format, lint, typecheck, test       |
| **Multi-agent safety**   | N/A               | Concurrent jobs      | Shared state         | Lane locking, branch isolation, coordination signals |
| **Domain extensibility** | Plugins / apps    | Marketplace actions  | Custom tools         | Pack system: manifest, scoped tools, policies        |

<Aside type="tip">
  LumenFlow can complement existing tools. Use Jira for planning and stakeholder communication,
  GitHub Actions for CI, and LumenFlow as the governance layer that ties execution together.
