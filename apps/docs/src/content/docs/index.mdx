## Four Guarantees

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Agents can't go off-script" icon="approve-check">
    4-level scope intersection: workspace, lane, task, and tool permissions must all agree before
    execution proceeds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Every action is provable" icon="document">
    Immutable evidence receipts with content-addressed inputs. Cryptographic proof of what was
    requested, allowed, and enforced.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policies are inescapable" icon="warning">
    Deny-wins cascade evaluated at every tool call. A restrictive policy at any level cannot be
    loosened by a lower level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation is OS-enforced" icon="setting">
    bwrap sandbox with write confinement and deny overlays on secrets. Enforced by the OS, not by
    the agent runtime.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
