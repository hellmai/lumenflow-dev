## The Problem Nobody Talks About

AI agents are getting really good at writing code, calling APIs, and shipping features. But here's the thing — nobody is watching them.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="No receipts" icon="warning">
    Your agent pushes to production on Tuesday. Six months later, compliance knocks on the door:
    "Who approved this?" You check git blame, Slack threads, PR comments... nothing. The agent
    didn't leave a trail because nobody asked it to.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No guardrails" icon="error">
    You tell your agent "don't touch .env files." Great advice. But advice is all it is — a polite
    suggestion in a system prompt that nothing actually enforces. One hallucination later, your
    secrets are in a commit message.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No boundaries" icon="close">
    You ask the agent to fix a login bug. It fixes the bug, refactors the payment module, updates
    three unrelated tests, and adds a dependency you've never heard of. Nothing stopped it because
    nothing could.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

LumenFlow fixes this. It sits between your agents and everything they touch — a **governance kernel** that enforces rules before actions happen, not after.

---

## Four Guarantees

These aren't features you can turn off. They're structural properties of the kernel — enforced at runtime, every time, for every agent.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Agents stay in their lane" icon="approve-check">
    A 4-level scope intersection checks workspace, lane, task, and tool permissions before any
    action proceeds. All four levels must agree. If any level says no, it's no.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Every action has a receipt" icon="document">
    Immutable, content-addressed evidence records capture what was requested, what was checked, and
    what happened. Not logs — cryptographic proof that can be independently verified.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policies can't be loosened" icon="warning">
    The deny-wins cascade means a restrictive policy at any level stays restrictive. A lane can't
    override a workspace rule. A task can't override a lane rule. Strictness only goes one
    direction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation is real" icon="setting">
    Agents run in bwrap sandboxes with write confinement and deny overlays on secrets. This is
    OS-level isolation — enforced by the Linux kernel, not by the agent runtime. Agents can't escape
    it even if they try.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Works With Any AI

If your AI assistant can read files and run commands, it can use LumenFlow. No vendor lock-in, no special SDK required. Just point your agent at `AGENTS.md` and go.

| Any AI Tool                                         | Enhanced Integrations                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Works out of the box via markdown instructions      | Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex get deeper features |
| CLI commands work everywhere — no lock-in           | Auto-detection, skills, vendor-specific overlays         |
| Universal entry points: `AGENTS.md`, `LUMENFLOW.md` | Optional: `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/` configs   |

<Aside type="tip">
  Already using an AI coding tool? LumenFlow doesn't replace it — it governs it. Your agents keep
  their full capabilities. They just can't color outside the lines anymore.

## Open Source by Design

LumenFlow is **free and open source** under a dual-license model built for trust:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="AGPL v3 — Kernel & Packs" icon="approve-check">
    The kernel, runtime, and all packs are licensed under **AGPL v3**. This means if you modify
    LumenFlow and deploy it as a service, you share your changes with the community. No proprietary
    forks. The same copyleft protection that keeps the kernel honest keeps the ecosystem honest too.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Apache 2.0 — SDK" icon="open-book">
    The Control Plane SDK is licensed under **Apache 2.0** — use it in proprietary projects,
    commercial products, or closed-source integrations with zero AGPL obligations. Build on
    LumenFlow without strings attached.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Every source file carries an SPDX license header. Every package has the correct license in `package.json`. A `NOTICE` file documents the full licensing model. We take this seriously because governance software that isn't transparent about its own governance would be a bad joke.

## Extensible by Design

The kernel is domain-agnostic on purpose. Domain knowledge comes from **packs** — pluggable extensions that add tools, policies, and evidence types for any workflow.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Software Delivery Pack" icon="setting">
    **Ships built-in.** Work Units, lanes, gates, worktrees, memory, flow metrics, and 100+ CLI
    commands for structured software delivery. This is what we use to build LumenFlow itself.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Build Your Own" icon="add-document">
    Customer support, data pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, compliance auditing — if you
    can define the rules, you can build a pack for it.

## How LumenFlow Compares

| Aspect                 | Scrum / Kanban    | GitHub Actions  | LangChain / CrewAI | **LumenFlow**                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent governance**   | None              | CI-only         | Trust the prompt   | 4-level scope, deny-wins policy engine      |
| **Evidence of work**   | Ticket status     | Logs            | None               | Immutable evidence receipts                 |
| **Sandbox isolation**  | None              | Container-level | None               | OS-level bwrap with secret deny overlays    |
| **Work partitioning**  | Columns / sprints | Workflows       | Agent roles        | Lanes with WIP limits + worktree isolation  |
| **Quality gates**      | PR review         | CI checks       | None               | Automated: format, lint, typecheck, test    |
| **Multi-agent safety** | N/A               | Concurrent jobs | Shared state       | Lane locking, branch isolation, signals     |
| **Licensing**          | N/A (methodology) | Proprietary     | MIT / Apache       | **AGPL v3** (kernel) + **Apache 2.0** (SDK) |
| **Extensibility**      | Plugins / apps    | Marketplace     | Custom tools       | Pack system with scoped tools + policies    |

<Aside type="tip">
  LumenFlow complements your existing stack. Keep Jira for planning, GitHub Actions for CI, and add
  LumenFlow as the governance layer that ties agent execution together.
