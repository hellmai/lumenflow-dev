  tagline: The governance layer between AI agents and the world. An open-source runtime kernel that controls what agents can do, proves what they did, and enforces policies they can't bypass.

## Four Guarantees

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Agents can't go off-script" icon="approve-check">
    4-level scope intersection: workspace, lane, task, and tool permissions must all agree before
    execution proceeds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Every action is provable" icon="document">
    Immutable evidence receipts with content-addressed inputs. Cryptographic proof of what was
    requested, allowed, and enforced.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policies are inescapable" icon="warning">
    Deny-wins cascade evaluated at every tool call. A restrictive policy at any level cannot be
    loosened by a lower level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation is OS-enforced" icon="setting">
    bwrap sandbox with write confinement and deny overlays on secrets. Enforced by the OS, not by
    the agent runtime.
  </Card>

LumenFlow scaffolds into your existing repo with git hooks, quality gates, work unit templates, and agent onboarding docs.

## Pack Marketplace

Packs are domain plugins that teach the LumenFlow kernel new capabilities. Install a pack to add tools, policies, and evidence types for any domain.

  <Card title="Software Delivery" icon="setting">
    **Built-in.** Git tools, worktree isolation, quality gates, lane-based work partitioning.

## LumenFlow vs Alternatives

How does LumenFlow governance compare to other approaches?

| Aspect                   | Scrum / Kanban    | GitHub Actions alone | LangChain / CrewAI   | LumenFlow                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent governance**     | None              | CI-only              | Trust the prompt     | 4-level scope, deny-wins policy engine               |
| **Evidence of work**     | Ticket status     | Logs                 | None                 | Immutable evidence receipts                          |
| **Sandbox isolation**    | None              | Container-level      | None                 | OS-level bwrap with secret deny overlays             |
| **Work partitioning**    | Columns / sprints | Workflows            | Agent roles          | Lanes with WIP limits and worktree isolation         |
| **Context recovery**     | Human memory      | None                 | Conversation history | Checkpointed memory layer with auto-recovery         |
| **Quality gates**        | PR review         | CI checks            | None                 | Automated gates: format, lint, typecheck, test       |
| **Multi-agent safety**   | N/A               | Concurrent jobs      | Shared state         | Lane locking, branch isolation, coordination signals |
| **Domain extensibility** | Plugins / apps    | Marketplace actions  | Custom tools         | Pack system: manifest, scoped tools, policies        |

<Aside type="tip">
  LumenFlow can complement existing tools. Use Jira for planning and stakeholder communication,
  GitHub Actions for CI, and LumenFlow as the governance layer that ties execution together.
