description: Legal licensing and access terms summary for LumenFlow
---

## Effective Date

This page reflects the LumenFlow licensing position as of **February 7, 2026**.

## Licensing Position

LumenFlow is currently **private software** and is **not publicly licensed**.

Access to the CLI and MCP packages is controlled through private distribution channels and governed
by applicable written terms.

Nothing on this documentation site grants rights to copy, modify, redistribute, or sublicense
LumenFlow software unless those rights are explicitly granted in writing.

## What Is Public vs Private

- **Public:** Documentation at `lumenflow.dev` (Starlight site), guides, and onboarding material
- **Private:** `@lumenflow/*` package distribution and MCP access
- **Case-by-case:** Commercial terms, redistribution rights, and organization-level access

## Access Model

To use private package distribution, your environment must have access to the configured package
registry and credentials.

Typical setup includes:

1. Registry configuration (`.npmrc` / workspace config)
2. Valid auth token in CI/local environment
3. Approved package scope access

For MCP usage, your AI client points to the installed `@lumenflow/mcp` package in your project.

## Third-Party Software

LumenFlow depends on third-party libraries. Those components remain under their own
licenses.

If you require third-party license notices for compliance review, request the current notice bundle
from the LumenFlow team.
