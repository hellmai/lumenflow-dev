## Effective Date

This page reflects the LumenFlow licensing position as of **February 17, 2026**.

## Open Source

LumenFlow is open-source software distributed under a dual-license model:

| Component                        | License                                                                              | SPDX Identifier |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Kernel, runtime, packs, surfaces | [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) | `AGPL-3.0-only` |
| Control Plane SDK                | [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)                    | `Apache-2.0`    |

### Why AGPL v3?

AGPL v3 ensures that anyone who modifies and deploys LumenFlow (including as a network service) must share their changes with the community. This protects the project from proprietary forks while keeping the code free for everyone to use, study, and improve.

### Why Apache 2.0 for the SDK?

The Control Plane SDK (`@lumenflow/control-plane-sdk`) defines the interface for building integrations and custom packs. Apache 2.0 removes friction for developers building on top of LumenFlow — you can use the SDK in proprietary projects without AGPL obligations.

## Commercial Licensing

Organizations that cannot comply with AGPL v3 (for example, those embedding LumenFlow in proprietary products) can obtain a commercial license from HellmAI.

Commercial licenses grant:

- Permission to use LumenFlow without AGPL obligations
- Enterprise support and SLA
- Access to the hosted control plane

Contact [tom@hellm.ai](mailto:tom@hellm.ai) for commercial licensing inquiries.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributions to LumenFlow require signing a [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/hellmai/294447585023baafc8c09d2c24617a91). The CLA grants HellmAI the right to distribute contributions under both the AGPL v3 and commercial licenses. Contributors retain copyright of their work.

The CLA is enforced automatically via [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io) on pull requests.

## Third-Party Software

LumenFlow depends on third-party libraries that remain under their own licenses. See `package.json` files in each package for dependency details.
