A Work Unit (WU) is a small, well-defined piece of work with clear acceptance criteria and proof of completion.

## Why WUs?

Traditional tickets are:

- Vague ("Fix the login bug")
- Unbounded (no clear definition of done)
- Trust-based (marked done without proof)

WUs are:

- Specific ("Add email validation to login form")
- Bounded (completable in a single session, \<50 tool calls)
- Evidence-based (tests and artifacts prove completion)

## Anatomy of a WU

```yaml
id: WU-042
title: Add email validation to login form
lane: 'Experience: UI'
type: feature
status: ready
priority: P2
exposure: ui

description: |
  Add client-side email validation before form submission.
  Show inline error message for invalid formats.

acceptance:
  - Email field validates on blur
  - Invalid emails show "Please enter a valid email"
  - Valid emails allow form submission
  - Unit test covers validation logic

test_paths:
  unit:
    - src/components/__tests__/login-form.test.ts
  e2e:
    - e2e/login.spec.ts

code_paths:
  - src/components/LoginForm.tsx
  - src/utils/validation.ts
```

:::note[Lane Format]
Lane names must use the "Parent: Sublane" format. Examples: `Framework: Core`, `Experience: UI`, `Operations: CI/CD`.
This is enforced by the `lanes.enforcement.require_parent` config setting.

## WU Lifecycle

```
ready → in_progress → [blocked] → done
```

| Status        | Meaning                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `ready`       | Approved, can be claimed       |
| `in_progress` | Someone is working on it       |
| `blocked`     | Waiting on external dependency |
| `done`        | Acceptance met, stamp created  |

## Right-Sizing WUs

WUs should be **completable in a single session** (\<50 tool calls, \<30% context). If bigger, split them.

### Too Big

❌ "Implement user authentication system"

### Right-Sized

✅ "Add login form UI"
✅ "Add password validation"
✅ "Connect login to auth API"
✅ "Add session persistence"

See [Sizing Guide](/guides/sizing) for detailed heuristics.

## WU vs PR

In LumenFlow:

| Traditional                                     | LumenFlow                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Create ticket → Code → Open PR → Review → Merge | Create WU → Claim → Code in worktree → Gates → Done |

The "review" is automated gates, not human PR review. This unblocks flow while maintaining quality.

## Evidence, Not Claims

Every WU completion creates:

1. **Stamp file** in `.lumenflow/stamps/WU-XXX.done`
2. **Test results** proving acceptance criteria
3. **Git history** linking to the WU spec

This audit trail is valuable for:

- Compliance reviews
- Team retrospectives
- Understanding "why was this built?"

## Creating WUs

```bash
# With required flags
pnpm wu:create \
  --title "Add password strength meter" \
  --lane "Experience: UI" \
  --type feature \
  --exposure ui \
  --description "Show password strength indicator during registration" \
  --acceptance "Strength meter shows weak/medium/strong" \
  --acceptance "Meter updates in real-time as user types" \
  --code-paths "src/components/PasswordStrength.tsx" \
  --test-paths-unit "src/components/__tests__/password-strength.test.ts" \
  --plan
```

The command prints the generated ID. The created WU goes into
`docs/04-operations/tasks/wu/WU-XXX.yaml` with status `ready`.

**Plan-less conversations:** If your plan lives in chat or a meeting, keep it lightweight:
use `--plan` to generate a stub at `lumenflow://plans/WU-XXX-plan.md`, summarize the plan
there, and reference it in `spec_refs`. Feature WUs require `spec_refs`; notes do not replace
the plan link.
