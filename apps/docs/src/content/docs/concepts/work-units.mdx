A Work Unit (WU) is a small, well-defined piece of work with clear acceptance criteria and proof of completion.

## Why WUs?

Traditional tickets are:

- Vague ("Fix the login bug")
- Unbounded (no clear definition of done)
- Trust-based (marked done without proof)

WUs are:

- Specific ("Add email validation to login form")
- Bounded (1-3 hours of work)
- Evidence-based (tests and artifacts prove completion)

## Anatomy of a WU

```yaml
id: WU-042
title: Add email validation to login form
lane: UI
type: feature
status: ready

description: |
  Add client-side email validation before form submission.
  Show inline error message for invalid formats.

acceptance:
  - Email field validates on blur
  - Invalid emails show "Please enter a valid email"
  - Valid emails allow form submission
  - Unit test covers validation logic

tests:
  unit:
    - src/components/__tests__/login-form.test.ts
  e2e:
    - e2e/login.spec.ts

code_paths:
  - src/components/LoginForm.tsx
  - src/utils/validation.ts
```

## WU Lifecycle

```
ready → in_progress → [blocked] → done
```

| Status        | Meaning                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `ready`       | Approved, can be claimed       |
| `in_progress` | Someone is working on it       |
| `blocked`     | Waiting on external dependency |
| `done`        | Acceptance met, stamp created  |

## Right-Sizing WUs

WUs should be **1-3 hours of work**. If bigger, split them.

### Too Big

❌ "Implement user authentication system"

### Right-Sized

✅ "Add login form UI"
✅ "Add password validation"
✅ "Connect login to auth API"
✅ "Add session persistence"

See [Sizing Guide](/guides/sizing) for detailed heuristics.

## WU vs PR

In LumenFlow:

| Traditional                                     | LumenFlow                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Create ticket → Code → Open PR → Review → Merge | Create WU → Claim → Code in worktree → Gates → Done |

The "review" is automated gates, not human PR review. This unblocks flow while maintaining quality.

## Evidence, Not Claims

Every WU completion creates:

1. **Stamp file** in `.beacon/stamps/WU-XXX.done`
2. **Test results** proving acceptance criteria
3. **Git history** linking to the WU spec

This audit trail is valuable for:

- Compliance reviews
- Team retrospectives
- Understanding "why was this built?"

## Creating WUs

```bash
# Interactive creation
pnpm wu:create

# With flags
pnpm wu:create \
  --id WU-043 \
  --title "Add password strength meter" \
  --lane UI \
  --type feature
```

The created WU goes into `docs/tasks/wu/WU-043.yaml` with status `ready`.
