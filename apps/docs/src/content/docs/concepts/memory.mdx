title: Memory Layer
description: Context recovery for long-running sessions
---

import { Aside, Steps, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Memory Layer preserves context across sessions, enabling AI agents and humans to resume work without losing track.

## Why Memory?

Without memory:

- "What was I working on?"
- "Why did I make this decision?"
- "Where did I leave off?"

With memory:

- Automatic checkpoints capture state
- Session context is recoverable
- Decisions are documented
- Discoveries become WUs

## How It Works

```
Session Start
     |
mem:ready (check pending work)
     |
Work (changes, decisions)
     |
mem:checkpoint (periodic save)
     |
Session End
     |
Next Session: mem:ready (resume)
```

## Memory Commands

### Initialize

```bash
pnpm mem:init
```

Creates `.lumenflow/memory/` with `memory.jsonl` and `config.yaml`.

### Start Session

```bash
pnpm mem:start --wu WU-001
```

Start a new memory session linked to a WU.

### Check Pending Work

```bash
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-001
```

Shows what's in progress and any pending decisions.

### Create Checkpoint

```bash
pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-042
```

Saves current session state:

- Active WU
- Recent changes
- Decision context

### Signal Progress

```bash
pnpm mem:signal "Completed validation logic" --wu WU-001
```

Send a progress signal that other sessions can see.

### Check Inbox

```bash
pnpm mem:inbox
```

Check for signals from other sessions or agents.

### Create Memory Node

```bash
pnpm mem:create "Found a bug in auth flow" --type discovery --wu WU-001
pnpm mem:create "API changed" --discovered-from mem-abc123 --tags api,breaking
```

Create a memory node with provenance tracking:

| Flag                | Description                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--type`            | `session`, `discovery`, `checkpoint`, `note`, `summary` |
| `--discovered-from` | Parent node ID for provenance chain                     |
| `--wu`              | Link to WU                                              |
| `--session`         | Link to session                                         |
| `--tags`            | Comma-separated tags                                    |
| `--priority`        | P0-P3                                                   |

### Triage Discoveries

```bash
pnpm mem:triage --list                     # List open discoveries
pnpm mem:triage --promote mem-abc --lane "Framework: Core" --title "Fix auth bug"
pnpm mem:triage --archive mem-def --reason "Duplicate of WU-100"
```

Review discovery nodes and either:

- **Promote** to a new WU
- **Archive** if not actionable

### Summarize Memory

```bash
pnpm mem:summarize --wu WU-001
pnpm mem:summarize --wu WU-001 --dry-run
```

Roll up older memory nodes into summary nodes. Use when context is getting large.

### Cleanup Memory

```bash
pnpm mem:cleanup                      # Cleanup based on lifecycle policy
pnpm mem:cleanup --dry-run            # Preview without changes
pnpm mem:cleanup --ttl 30d            # Remove nodes older than 30 days
pnpm mem:cleanup --session-id <uuid>  # Close specific session
```

Prune memory nodes based on lifecycle policy.

## Memory Structure

```
.lumenflow/
├── memory/
│   ├── memory.jsonl
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── signals.jsonl
├── sessions/
│   └── current.json
├── stamps/
│   └── WU-041.done
└── locks/
    └── core.lock
```

## Session Context

Each session captures:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "started_at": "2026-01-18T10:00:00Z",
  "active_wu": "WU-042",
  "lane": "Framework: Core",
  "files_touched": ["src/utils/validation.ts", "src/components/LoginForm.tsx"],
  "decisions": [
    {
      "question": "Use Zod or custom validation?",
      "answer": "Zod - better TypeScript integration",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-18T10:15:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Agent Session Handoff

A common scenario: one agent works on a WU, hits context limits, and hands off to a fresh agent.

**Agent 1 (hitting context limits):**

```bash
# Agent 1 is running low on context
# Save state before ending session
pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-042

# Signal where we left off
pnpm mem:signal "Tests written for auth flow, starting integration tests" --wu WU-042

# Document the key decision made
pnpm mem:create "Decision: Token refresh uses silent retry queue" \
  --type note \
  --wu WU-042 \
  --tags decision,auth \
  --priority P2
```

**Agent 2 (resuming):**

```bash
# New agent checks what's pending
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-042

# Output:
# Session: abc123
# WU: WU-042 (in_progress)
# Lane: Framework: Core
# Last signal: "Tests written for auth flow, starting integration tests"
# Files touched:
#   - src/utils/auth.ts
#   - src/components/LoginForm.tsx
#   - tests/auth.test.ts
#
# Pending decisions: 1
#   - Token refresh: Silent refresh with retry queue

# Resume work with full context
cd worktrees/framework-core-wu-042
```

### Example 2: Discovery to WU Pipeline

Finding bugs or improvements during work and converting them to WUs.

```bash
# During WU-042, agent finds a bug in unrelated code
pnpm mem:create "Found race condition in session manager" \
  --type discovery \
  --wu WU-042 \
  --priority P1 \
  --tags bug,auth,race-condition

# Later, triage the discovery
pnpm mem:triage --list
# Output:
# mem-def456: Found race condition in session manager
#   Type: discovery
#   Priority: P1
#   Discovered during: WU-042
#   Tags: bug, auth, race-condition

# Promote to a new WU
pnpm mem:triage --promote mem-def456 \
  --lane "Framework: Core" \
  --title "BUG: Fix race condition in session manager"

# Creates WU-043 with:
# - Type: bug
# - Priority: P1
# - discovered_in: WU-042
# - Linked to memory node for context
```

### Example 3: Long-Running Research Session

For discovery or research WUs that span multiple days.

```bash
# Day 1: Start research
pnpm mem:start --wu WU-050

# Make progress, save decisions
pnpm mem:create "Decision: OpenTelemetry + Grafana" \
  --type note \
  --wu WU-050 \
  --tags observability,decision

pnpm mem:signal "Evaluated 3 platforms, OTel winning" --wu WU-050
pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-050

# Day 2: Continue
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-050
# Shows: Last checkpoint from Day 1, decision context preserved

# Add more findings
pnpm mem:create "OTel has better trace propagation" \
  --type note \
  --wu WU-050 \
  --tags observability,decision

# Day 3: Wrap up
pnpm mem:summarize --wu WU-050
# Creates summary node:
# "Research on observability platforms. Decision: OpenTelemetry + Grafana.
#  Key factors: vendor neutral, trace propagation, ecosystem maturity."
```

### Example 4: Multi-Agent Coordination

Multiple agents working on related WUs in different lanes.

<Aside type="note">
  Configure `progress_signals.enabled: true` in `.lumenflow.config.yaml` to make signaling mandatory
  for sub-agents. See [Progress Signals](#progress-signals) for all options.
</Aside>

```bash
# Agent A working on Core (WU-100)
pnpm mem:signal "New validation port added: ValidationService" --wu WU-100

# Agent B working on UI (WU-101) checks inbox
pnpm mem:inbox
# Output:
# From: session-abc (WU-100, Framework: Core)
#   Signal: "New validation port added: ValidationService"
#   Time: 5 minutes ago

# Agent B can now use the new port
# No need for synchronous coordination
```

### Example 5: Checkpoint Before Context Limit

<Aside type="caution">
  When approaching context limits (high token usage, 50+ tool calls), create a checkpoint and spawn
  a fresh agent instead of continuing.
</Aside>

```bash
# Agent detects high context usage
# Before spawning new agent:

# 1. Checkpoint current state
pnpm mem:checkpoint

# 2. Signal detailed progress
pnpm mem:signal "Auth flow 80% complete. Remaining: integration tests for refresh token. Files ready: src/auth/*.ts" --wu WU-042

# 3. Document any in-progress decisions
pnpm mem:create "Decision pending: error handling strategy (throw vs Result type)" \
  --type note \
  --wu WU-042 \
  --tags decision,pending

# 4. Now safe to spawn fresh agent
# New agent will have full context via mem:ready
```

## AI Agent Integration

For AI agents, memory is critical:

```bash
# Agent starts session
pnpm mem:start --wu WU-042

# Agent checks what's pending
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-042

# During work, agent signals progress
pnpm mem:signal "Completed validation logic, starting tests" --wu WU-042

# Agent creates checkpoint before pause
pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-042

# Later, agent resumes
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-042
# Shows: "WU-042 in progress, last: 'starting tests'"
```

## Decision Logging

Capture why decisions were made:

```bash
pnpm mem:create "Decision: use Zod for validation" \
  --type note \
  --wu WU-042 \
  --tags decision
```

This creates an audit trail for future reference.

## Configuration

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
memory:
  checkpoint_interval: 30 # minutes
  max_checkpoints: 10 # per WU
  auto_checkpoint: true # on significant changes
```

### Progress Signals

For sub-agent coordination, configure when agents must signal their progress:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
memory:
  progress_signals:
    enabled: true # When true, signals become mandatory
    frequency: 25 # Signal every N tool calls (0 = disabled)
    on_milestone: true # Signal after each acceptance criterion
    on_tests_pass: true # Signal when tests first pass
    before_gates: true # Signal before running gates
    on_blocked: true # Signal when blocked or waiting
    auto_checkpoint: false # Create checkpoint with each signal
```

| Field             | Default | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`         | `false` | When `true`, signals are required at trigger points |
| `frequency`       | `0`     | Tool calls between auto-signals (0 = no frequency)  |
| `on_milestone`    | `true`  | Signal after completing each acceptance criterion   |
| `on_tests_pass`   | `true`  | Signal when tests first pass                        |
| `before_gates`    | `true`  | Signal before running quality gates                 |
| `on_blocked`      | `true`  | Signal when blocked or waiting on dependencies      |
| `auto_checkpoint` | `false` | Automatically create checkpoint with each signal    |

<Aside type="tip" title="Sub-Agent Visibility">
  Enable `progress_signals.enabled: true` when orchestrating sub-agents. This ensures the parent
  agent can track progress via `mem:inbox` without polling.
</Aside>

**When to use:**

- **Parallel WUs**: When multiple agents work on related WUs, signals prevent redundant work
- **Long-running tasks**: For complex WUs, signals provide progress visibility
- **Orchestrator patterns**: Parent agents can monitor child progress without context overhead

## Best Practices

### For Humans

<Steps>

1. Run `mem:ready --wu <WU-ID>` at session start
2. Create checkpoints before long breaks
3. Log non-obvious decisions
4. Triage discoveries weekly

</Steps>

### For AI Agents

<Steps>

1. Always start with `mem:start --wu <WU-ID>`
2. Signal progress frequently
3. Checkpoint before context limits
4. Use discoveries for out-of-scope findings

</Steps>

### Checkpoint Triggers

Create a checkpoint when:

- Completing a significant milestone
- Before switching to a different task
- Before a long break or end of day
- When context usage is high
- Before spawning a sub-agent

### Discovery Guidelines

Use discoveries for:

- Bugs found in unrelated code
- Improvement ideas outside current scope
- Technical debt observations
- Questions for later research

Do NOT use discoveries for:

- Things you'll fix in the current WU
- Obvious next steps already in backlog
- Personal notes (use `--type note` instead)

## Memory Lifecycle

<Card title="Lifecycle Stages" icon="information">

**Active** (during WU work)

- Checkpoints created frequently
- Signals sent on milestones
- Decisions logged as made

**Archive** (after WU completion)

- Checkpoints summarized
- Discoveries triaged
- Session closed

**Cleanup** (periodic maintenance)

- Old checkpoints pruned
- Archived sessions cleaned
- Summary nodes preserved
