title: Lanes
description: Parallel work streams with WIP limits
---

Lanes are parallel work streams that organize work by domain and prevent overload through WIP (Work-in-Progress) limits.

## Why Lanes?

Without lanes:

- Everything competes for attention
- Context switching kills productivity
- Bottlenecks form unpredictably

With lanes:

- Work is organized by domain
- Each lane has focused attention
- WIP limits prevent overload

## Defining Lanes

Lanes use a `Parent: Sublane` naming convention to organize work hierarchically:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
version: '2.0'

lanes:
  enforcement:
    require_parent: true # Enforce Parent: Sublane format
    allow_custom: false # Only taxonomy lanes allowed

  definitions:
    - name: 'Framework: Core'
      wip_limit: 1
      code_paths:
        - 'packages/@lumenflow/core/**'

    - name: 'Framework: CLI'
      wip_limit: 1
      code_paths:
        - 'packages/@lumenflow/cli/**'

    - name: 'Operations: Infrastructure'
      wip_limit: 1
      code_paths:
        - 'apps/**'
        - 'actions/**'

    - name: 'Content: Documentation'
      wip_limit: 1
      code_paths:
        - 'docs/**'
```

### Parent Lane Categories

| Parent     | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Framework  | Core libraries, CLI, memory, agents |
| Operations | Infrastructure, CI/CD, tooling      |
| Content    | Documentation, guides               |
| Experience | UI components, pages                |

## WIP Limits

WIP (Work-in-Progress) limits enforce **one active WU per lane** (WIP=1). This prevents:

- Context switching between multiple incomplete tasks
- Merge conflicts from parallel work in the same domain
- "Started but not finished" pile-ups

**Current behavior:** WIP=1 is enforced for all lanes. Attempting to claim a WU in an occupied lane will be blocked.

**Parallel work:** Use multiple lanes to work in parallel. Each lane can have one active WU, enabling concurrent work across different domains.

## Lock Policy

The `lock_policy` field controls how blocked WUs affect lane availability:

```yaml
lanes:
  definitions:
    - name: 'Content: Documentation'
      wip_limit: 1
      lock_policy: active  # blocked WUs release lane lock
      code_paths:
        - 'docs/**'
```

| Policy   | Behavior                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `all`    | Default. Blocked WUs count toward WIP. Lane stays occupied when blocked. |
| `active` | Only in_progress WUs count. Blocked WUs release the lane lock.           |
| `none`   | WIP checking disabled. Multiple WUs can be claimed regardless of status. |

### When to Use Each Policy

- **`all` (default)**: High-conflict lanes where blocked work may resume soon
- **`active`**: Low-conflict lanes like documentation where blocked work is unlikely to cause merge conflicts
- **`none`**: Experimental. Use only for lanes with guaranteed non-overlapping work

### Pilot Recommendation

Start with `lock_policy: active` on low-conflict lanes like **Content: Documentation**:

1. Documentation WUs are low-conflict (different files, few dependencies)
2. Blocked docs WUs rarely resume immediately
3. Easy rollback: change `active` back to `all` in config

### Rollback

If `lock_policy: active` causes issues:

1. Update `.lumenflow.config.yaml`: change `lock_policy: active` to `lock_policy: all`
2. Run `pnpm wu:unlock-lane --lane "<lane>"` to clear stale locks

### Why WIP=1 Matters

```
High WIP (anti-pattern):
→ Multiple things started, none finished
→ Context switching overhead
→ Long cycle times
→ Merge conflicts

WIP=1 (LumenFlow default):
→ Finish one thing
→ Start the next
→ Steady flow
→ Clean merges
```

## Lane Selection

When claiming a WU, specify the full `Parent: Sublane` format:

```bash
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-042 --lane "Experience: UI"
```

The WU spec should already have a lane assignment:

```yaml
# WU-042.yaml
id: WU-042
title: Add email validation
lane: 'Experience: UI' # ← Full Parent: Sublane format
```

## Auto-Detection via Paths

LumenFlow can auto-detect lanes based on file paths using the lane inference system:

```yaml
# .lumenflow.lane-inference.yaml
Framework:
  Core:
    code_paths:
      - 'packages/@lumenflow/core/**'
    keywords:
      - 'core library'
      - 'wu lifecycle'
```

If a WU's `code_paths` match a pattern, the sublane is suggested automatically.

## Multiple Lanes

A WU should belong to **one lane**. If work spans multiple domains:

1. **Split the WU** – One WU per lane
2. **Choose primary** – Assign to the most affected lane

### Example: Feature Spanning UI + Core

Instead of one WU:
❌ "Add user preferences (UI + API + DB)"

Split into:
✅ WU-100: "Add preferences API" (lane: Framework: Core)
✅ WU-101: "Add preferences UI" (lane: Experience: UI)
✅ WU-102: "Add preferences schema" (lane: Operations: Infrastructure)

## Visualizing Lanes

The status file shows lane state:

```markdown
# Status

## 🔧 In Progress

- [WU-101 — Add preferences UI](wu/WU-101.yaml) (lane: Experience: UI)
- [WU-100 — Add preferences API](wu/WU-100.yaml) (lane: Framework: Core)

## 🚀 Ready

- [WU-103 — Add dark mode toggle](wu/WU-103.yaml) (lane: Experience: UI) ← blocked (lane occupied)
- [WU-104 — Add export feature](wu/WU-104.yaml) (lane: Operations: Infrastructure) ← can claim

## ⛔ Blocked

(none)
```

Note: WU-103 cannot be claimed because Experience: UI lane already has WU-101 in progress.
