## General

### What is LumenFlow?

LumenFlow is an AI-native delivery methodology for software teams. It provides a structured workflow where humans and AI agents collaborate using Work Units (WUs), automated gates, and lane-based flow.

### Is LumenFlow a project management tool?

No. LumenFlow is a methodology with CLI tooling. It integrates with your existing Git workflow and CI/CD pipeline. You can use it alongside tools like Jira, Linear, or GitHub Projects for higher-level planning.

### Do I need AI agents to use LumenFlow?

No. LumenFlow works for human-only teams too. The workflow (WUs, gates, lanes) benefits any team that wants faster feedback and evidence-based completion. AI integration is a bonus, not a requirement.

### Is LumenFlow publicly licensed?

No. LumenFlow is currently private software. See [Licensing & Access](/legal/licensing/) for
the current model.

### Is LumenFlow free?

Documentation is public at `lumenflow.dev`. Package and MCP access are private and depend on your
access agreement. See [Licensing & Access](/legal/licensing/).

## Work Units (WUs)

### What's the difference between a WU and a ticket?

A WU is an executable specification. It includes:

- Acceptance criteria that define "done"
- Code paths that scope what can be changed
- Test paths for verification

A ticket is typically just a description. A WU is a contract.

### How big should a WU be?

Small enough to complete in a single session (2-4 hours for humans, faster for AI). If a WU takes longer, split it.

Rule of thumb:

- 1-3 acceptance criteria
- Touches 1-2 code paths
- Has clear, testable outcomes

### Can multiple people work on the same WU?

No. WIP=1 per lane means one WU per lane at a time. If you need parallel work, use multiple lanes or split the WU.

### What if I find a bug while working on a WU?

If the bug is in your `code_paths` and small (under 10 lines), fix it in place. Otherwise, create a new WU for the bug and finish your current work first.

## Lanes

### What are lanes?

Lanes are parallel tracks for different domains of work. Examples:

- `Framework: Core` - Core business logic
- `Experience: UI` - User interface
- `Operations: Infrastructure` - DevOps and CI/CD

Each lane can have one WU in progress at a time (WIP=1).

### How do I choose lane names?

Use the "Parent: Sublane" format. Common parents:

- Framework (code packages)
- Experience (UI/UX)
- Operations (infrastructure, CI/CD)
- Content (documentation, marketing)

### Can I have custom lanes?

Yes, define them in `.lumenflow.config.yaml`:

```yaml
lanes:
  definitions:
    - name: 'Framework: Payments'
      code_paths: ['src/payments/**']
    - name: 'Experience: Mobile'
      code_paths: ['apps/mobile/**']
```

## Gates

### What are gates?

Gates are automated quality checks that run before a WU can be completed:

- Format check (Prettier, gofmt)
- Lint check (ESLint, ruff)
- Type check (TypeScript, mypy)
- Tests (Vitest, pytest)

### Can I skip gates?

Only for pre-existing failures with proper documentation. Normally, gates run via `wu:prep` in the
worktree:

```bash
pnpm wu:done --id WU-042 --skip-gates \
  --reason "Pre-existing lint failure" \
  --fix-wu WU-050
```

Never skip gates for failures introduced by your own work.

### Do gates replace code review?

For most changes, yes. Gates provide faster, more consistent feedback than human review. For critical changes (auth, payments, PHI), use escalation triggers to require human approval.

## Worktrees

### What is a worktree?

A Git worktree is a separate working directory linked to the same repository. LumenFlow creates a worktree for each WU, isolating your work from other changes.

### Why use worktrees instead of branches?

Worktrees provide true isolation:

- Your in-progress changes don't affect others
- You can switch WUs without stashing
- Multiple WUs can run in parallel (one per lane)

### What happens to my worktree when I finish?

`pnpm wu:prep` and `pnpm wu:done` together:

1. `wu:prep` runs gates in the worktree
2. `wu:done` merges to main (fast-forward)
3. `wu:done` creates the stamp
4. `wu:done` deletes the worktree

## CLI

### Do I need to install the CLI?

The CLI provides the full LumenFlow experience (worktrees, gates, memory). Without it, you can still use LumenFlow with manual WU YAML management.

### What Node.js version do I need?

Node.js 22 or higher (LTS recommended).

### Does the CLI work with npm?

Yes. We recommend pnpm, but npm works too:

```bash
npm install -D @lumenflow/cli
npx wu-create --title "Update README" --lane "Operations: Documentation" \
  --type documentation --exposure documentation \
  --description "Clarify setup steps" \
  --acceptance "README includes updated setup instructions"
```

## AI Agents

### Which AI tools work with LumenFlow?

Any AI coding assistant that can:

- Read files (WU specs, code)
- Write code
- Run commands

Popular options: Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Aider, Continue.

### How do AI agents know what to do?

They read the WU spec:

```yaml
acceptance:
  - Users can log in with email/password
  - JWT tokens issued with 1-hour expiry
code_paths:
  - src/auth/
```

The spec tells them what to build and where to put it.

### Can AI agents run wu:done?

Yes. AI agents can run the full workflow:

```bash
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-042 --lane "Framework: Core"
cd worktrees/framework-core-wu-042
# ... implement ...
pnpm wu:prep --id WU-042
cd /path/to/repo
pnpm wu:done --id WU-042
```

<Aside type="caution">
  AI agents should not use `--skip-gates` without explicit human approval.
