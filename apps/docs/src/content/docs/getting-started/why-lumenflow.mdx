LumenFlow is not another project management tool. It is a delivery methodology designed for AI-augmented software teams, where both humans and AI agents collaborate on the same codebase.

## The Problem with Traditional Methodologies

Most software teams use methodologies designed for human-only workflows:

| Method       | Assumes                              | Breaks When                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrum**    | 2-week sprints, ceremonies, velocity | AI can ship 10x faster, sprints feel slow     |
| **Kanban**   | Visual board, WIP limits, flow       | AI agents overwhelm boards with parallel work |
| **Shape Up** | 6-week cycles, appetite, betting     | AI makes "betting" obsolete, cycles too long  |

These methodologies were designed when humans were the only workers. They assume:

- Work takes days or weeks
- Context is held in human heads
- Progress is measured in story points or cycle time

AI agents change all of this.

## How LumenFlow Is Different

### 1. Work Units, Not Stories or Tickets

Traditional tickets are vague: "Add user authentication"

LumenFlow Work Units are executable specifications:

```yaml
id: WU-042
title: Add JWT authentication
lane: 'Framework: Core'
type: feature
acceptance:
  - Users can authenticate with email/password
  - JWT tokens issued with 1-hour expiry
  - Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
code_paths:
  - src/auth/
test_paths:
  unit:
    - src/auth/__tests__/
```

An AI agent can read this spec and implement it autonomously. A human can verify completion by checking the acceptance criteria.

### 2. Lanes, Not Sprints

Scrum batches work into time-boxed sprints. LumenFlow flows work through parallel lanes.

```
Lane: Framework: Core     [WU-042 in_progress] [WU-043 ready] [WU-044 ready]
Lane: Experience: UI      [WU-045 in_progress] [WU-046 blocked]
Lane: Operations: Infra   [WU-047 done] [WU-048 ready]
```

Each lane has a WIP limit (typically 1 for solo work, 3 for teams). Work flows continuously instead of waiting for sprint boundaries.

### 3. Gates, Not Reviews

Code review is a bottleneck. Reviewers are busy. PRs sit for days.

LumenFlow replaces manual review with automated gates:

```bash
pnpm gates
# Format check... pass
# Lint check... pass
# Type check... pass
# Tests... pass
# All gates passed!
```

If gates pass, work is done. No waiting. No negotiation. No "LGTM" comments.

<Aside type="note">
  Gates don't eliminate human oversight. Critical changes (auth, payments, PII) can require human
  approval via escalation triggers in the WU spec.
</Aside>

### 4. Memory, Not Standups

Daily standups exist because humans forget context overnight. AI agents need explicit context recovery.

LumenFlow's memory layer:

```bash
# Before stopping work
pnpm mem:checkpoint --wu WU-042

# Next session (human or AI)
pnpm mem:ready --wu WU-042
# Shows: last state, pending work, blockers
```

No need to ask "what was I working on?" or "where did I leave off?"

### 5. Stamps, Not Done Columns

Kanban boards have "Done" columns. Items move there when someone decides they're done.

LumenFlow creates immutable stamps:

```
.lumenflow/stamps/WU-042.done
```

A stamp is created only when:

- All acceptance criteria pass
- All gates pass
- Work is merged to main

No ambiguity. No "is this really done?" debates.

| Aspect      | Scrum              | Kanban      | Shape Up       | LumenFlow       |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Time unit   | 2-week sprints     | Continuous  | 6-week cycles  | Continuous      |
| Work item   | User story         | Card        | Pitch          | Work Unit (WU)  |
| Progress    | Story points       | Cycle time  | Hill charts    | Gates + stamps  |
| Parallelism | Team velocity      | WIP limits  | Team per pitch | Lane-based WIP  |
| Reviews     | Sprint review + PR | PR review   | Demo           | Automated gates |
| AI-ready    | No                 | Partially   | No             | Yes             |
| Context     | Human memory       | Board state | Write-up       | Memory layer    |

## When to Use LumenFlow

**LumenFlow is ideal when:**

- You use AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
- You want faster feedback than code review provides
- You need multiple streams of work in parallel
- You value evidence (tests, gates) over process (ceremonies, meetings)

**LumenFlow may not fit when:**

- Your team relies on manual code review for knowledge sharing
- You need sprint-based planning for stakeholder communication
- You prefer visual Kanban boards for work visibility

<Aside type="tip">
  LumenFlow can complement existing methodologies. Use Scrum for planning and stakeholder
  communication, but execute the actual work with LumenFlow's WU/gates/stamps flow.
</Aside>

## Philosophy

LumenFlow is built on four beliefs:

1. **Backlog is law** - If a WU is approved, it can be executed autonomously
2. **Evidence over claims** - Tests and artifacts prove work is done
3. **Flow over batching** - Continuous delivery beats sprint cycles
4. **AI as collaborator** - Agents are first-class team members
