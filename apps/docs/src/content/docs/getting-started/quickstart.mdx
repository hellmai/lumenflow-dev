import { Steps, Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution" title="AI Agents: Follow These Steps Exactly">
  This quickstart is designed for AI agents and humans alike. Execute commands in order. Do not skip
  steps. Do not manually edit managed files. Each command produces the correct output—trust the CLI.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

Verify these tools are installed before proceeding.

```bash
node --version   # Requires 22.0.0+
pnpm --version   # Requires 9.0.0+
git --version    # Requires 2.0.0+
```

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not proceed if any version check fails. Install missing tools first.
</Aside>

---

## Step 1: Install the CLI

Run this command in your project root.

```bash
pnpm add -D @lumenflow/cli
```

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not install globally with `-g`. Install as a dev dependency so the whole team uses the same
  version.
</Aside>

---

## Step 2: Initialize LumenFlow

Run this command. It creates all required configuration files.

```bash
pnpm exec lumenflow
```

This creates:

- `.lumenflow.config.yaml` — Configuration (managed)
- `LUMENFLOW.md` — Workflow entry point (managed)
- `AGENTS.md` — Universal AI agent entry point (managed)
- `.lumenflow/constraints.md` — Non-negotiable constraints (managed)

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not manually create these files. Do not edit `.lumenflow.config.yaml` by hand. Use CLI commands
  to modify configuration.
</Aside>

---

## Step 3: Add Scripts to package.json

Add these scripts to your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "wu:create": "wu-create",
    "wu:claim": "wu-claim",
    "wu:prep": "wu-prep",
    "wu:done": "wu-done",
    "gates": "gates"
  }
}
```

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not rename these scripts. Other LumenFlow tools expect these exact names.
</Aside>

---

## Step 4: Create Your First Work Unit

Run this command. Replace the values with your actual task details.

```bash
pnpm wu:create \
  --title "Fix login error banner" \
  --lane "Experience: UI" \
  --type bug \
  --exposure ui \
  --description "Fix error banner overlap on small screens" \
  --acceptance "Error banner no longer overlaps the form on mobile widths" \
  --code-paths "src/components/LoginError.tsx" \
  --test-paths-unit "src/components/__tests__/LoginError.test.tsx"
```

The CLI prints a WU ID (example: `WU-123`). Use this ID in subsequent commands.

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not manually create WU YAML files in `docs/04-operations/tasks/wu/`. Do not manually edit WU
  YAML files. Use `pnpm wu:create` and `pnpm wu:edit` commands.
</Aside>

---

## Step 5: Claim the Work Unit

Run this command with the ID from Step 4.

```bash
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-123 --lane "Experience: UI"
```

This creates a worktree at `worktrees/experience-ui-wu-123/`.

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not skip this step. Do not work on main branch. Do not use `git worktree add` directly.
</Aside>

---

## Step 6: Enter the Worktree

Run this command immediately after claiming.

```bash
cd worktrees/experience-ui-wu-123
```

All work happens inside this directory.

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not edit files on main branch. Do not use absolute paths that point outside the worktree.
  Always use relative paths.
</Aside>

---

## Step 7: Implement and Commit

Write your code. Write tests. Commit your changes.

```bash
# Write code and tests, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve error banner overlap on mobile"
```

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not commit without tests. Do not use `--no-verify` to skip hooks. Fix any hook failures
  properly.
</Aside>

---

## Step 8: Run Gates in Worktree

Run this command from inside the worktree.

```bash
pnpm wu:prep --id WU-123
```

This runs all quality gates (format, lint, typecheck, test). It prints the next command to run.

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not skip gates. Do not proceed if gates fail. Fix failures before continuing.
</Aside>

---

## Step 9: Complete the Work Unit

Run this command from the **main checkout** (not the worktree).

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
pnpm wu:done --id WU-123
```

This merges your work to main, creates a completion stamp, and removes the worktree.

<Aside type="danger" title="DO NOT">
  Do not run `wu:done` from inside the worktree. Do not manually merge branches. Do not manually
  create stamp files.
</Aside>

---

## Verify Success

After `wu:done` completes, verify these conditions.

- WU YAML status is `done`
- Stamp file exists at `.lumenflow/stamps/WU-123.done`
- Worktree directory is removed
- Changes are on main branch

---

## File Ownership

LumenFlow manages certain files automatically. Understand which files you own.

| File/Directory                        | Owner     | Action                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.lumenflow.config.yaml`              | LumenFlow | Do not edit manually. Use CLI commands.                 |
| `LUMENFLOW.md`                        | LumenFlow | Do not edit. Regenerated on init.                       |
| `AGENTS.md`                           | LumenFlow | Do not edit. Regenerated on init.                       |
| `.lumenflow/constraints.md`           | LumenFlow | Do not edit. Contains workflow rules.                   |
| `.lumenflow/stamps/`                  | LumenFlow | Do not create manually. Created by `wu:done`.           |
| `docs/04-operations/tasks/wu/*.yaml`  | LumenFlow | Do not create/edit manually. Use `wu:create`/`wu:edit`. |
| `docs/04-operations/tasks/backlog.md` | LumenFlow | Do not edit. Regenerated from state.                    |
| `docs/04-operations/tasks/status.md`  | LumenFlow | Do not edit. Regenerated from state.                    |
| `worktrees/`                          | LumenFlow | Do not create manually. Created by `wu:claim`.          |
| Your source code                      | You       | Edit freely inside worktrees.                           |
| Your tests                            | You       | Edit freely inside worktrees.                           |
| `package.json` scripts                | You       | Add the required scripts once.                          |
