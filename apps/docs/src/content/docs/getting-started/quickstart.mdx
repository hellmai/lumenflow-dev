This guide gets you from zero to a working LumenFlow setup in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or 22+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- A Git repository

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Install the CLI**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">```bash pnpm add -D @lumenflow/cli ```</TabItem>
     <TabItem label="npm">```bash npm install -D @lumenflow/cli ```</TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Initialize LumenFlow**

   ```bash
   pnpm exec lumenflow init
   ```

   This creates:
   - `.lumenflow.config.yaml` – Your configuration
   - `docs/tasks/backlog.md` – Your task board
   - `docs/tasks/wu/` – Where WU specs live
   - `.beacon/stamps/` – Completion proofs

3. **Add scripts to package.json**

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "wu:create": "wu-create",
       "wu:claim": "wu-claim",
       "wu:done": "wu-done",
       "gates": "gates"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Create your first Work Unit**

   ```bash
   pnpm wu:create \
     --id WU-001 \
     --title "Add user authentication" \
     --lane Core
   ```

5. **Claim and start work**

   ```bash
   pnpm wu:claim --id WU-001 --lane Core
   cd worktrees/core-wu-001
   ```

</Steps>

## Workflow

Once set up, your daily workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Claim a WU from the backlog
pnpm wu:claim --id WU-XXX --lane Core

# 2. Work in the worktree
cd worktrees/core-wu-xxx
# ... make changes ...

# 3. Run gates (checks your work)
pnpm gates

# 4. Complete the WU
cd ../..
pnpm wu:done --id WU-XXX
```

## Verify It's Working

After `wu:done`, you should see:

- ✅ WU status changed to `done`
- ✅ Stamp file created in `.beacon/stamps/`
- ✅ Worktree merged and cleaned up
- ✅ Backlog updated
