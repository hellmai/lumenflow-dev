description: Add LumenFlow enforcement to your repository

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The LumenFlow GitHub App adds automated enforcement to your repository via pull requests.

## What It Does

| Feature               | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **PR Validation**     | Checks that PRs reference valid WU specs |
| **WIP Enforcement**   | Ensures lane limits aren't exceeded      |
| **Completion Stamps** | Auto-creates stamp commits on merge      |
| **Labels**            | Adds lane and status labels to PRs       |

## Installation

<Steps>

1. **Visit the GitHub Marketplace**

   Go to [github.com/apps/lumenflow-by-hellmai](https://github.com/apps/lumenflow-by-hellmai)

2. **Click "Install"**

   Choose which repositories to install on (all or select repos).

3. **Authorize**

   Grant the app permission to read/write PRs and checks.

4. **Done!**

   The app is now active on your repository.

</Steps>

## How It Works

When you open a PR:

1. **App validates** the PR title/body for WU reference
2. **App checks** WIP limits for the target lane
3. **App adds** labels (e.g., `lane:core`, `status:in-progress`)
4. **On merge**, app creates a completion stamp

## Configuration

The app reads your `.lumenflow.config.yaml` for:

- Lane definitions and WIP limits
- Directory mappings for auto-detection
- Gate requirements

```yaml
# Example config
lanes:
  - name: Core
    wip_limit: 1
    paths: ['src/core/**']
  - name: UI
    wip_limit: 2
    paths: ['src/components/**']
```

## CLI vs App

| Capability        | CLI Only   | With App  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Create WUs        | ✅         | ✅        |
| Run gates locally | ✅         | ✅        |
| PR validation     | ❌         | ✅        |
| WIP enforcement   | Local only | Repo-wide |
| Team visibility   | ❌         | ✅        |

**Solo developers**: CLI is sufficient.
**Teams**: Add the app for enforcement and visibility.

## Troubleshooting

### App not responding to PRs

- Check the app is installed on the repo
- Verify `.lumenflow.config.yaml` exists and is valid
- Check webhook delivery in repo settings

### WU not recognized

- Ensure WU YAML exists in the configured `wu_specs` directory
- Check the WU ID format matches your PR title
