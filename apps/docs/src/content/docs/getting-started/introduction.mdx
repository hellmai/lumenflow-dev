title: What is LumenFlow?
description: AI-native workflow for software teams
---

LumenFlow is an open, stack-agnostic delivery methodology for AI-augmented teams. It combines test-driven development with a lane-based flow system that keeps work visible, parallel, and humane.

## Why LumenFlow?

1. **Clarity over chaos** – Every Work Unit (WU) has an explicit state, owner, and outcome. No ambiguity.

2. **AI as a first-class collaborator** – Instructions, ports, and tests let AI agents contribute safely and autonomously.

3. **Focus without bottlenecks** – Lane-based WIP keeps individual streams calm while teams move together.

4. **Evidence, not claims** – Tests and artifacts prove the work is done, not just "closed".

## Core Concepts

| Concept              | What it Does                                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work Units (WUs)** | Tiny, testable jobs with clear acceptance criteria                                |
| **Lanes**            | Parallel tracks for different domains (e.g., `Framework: Core`, `Experience: UI`) |
| **Gates**            | Automated quality checks (lint, test, typecheck)                                  |
| **Memory**           | Context recovery for long-running sessions                                        |

## How It Works

```
Backlog (ready)
      ↓ claim a WU
Lane board (one WU per lane)
      ↓ implement with TDD
Gates (lint, test, typecheck)
      ↓ all green
Done (stamp committed)
```

## Quick Example

```yaml
# .lumenflow.config.yaml
version: '2.0'
lanes:
  enforcement:
    require_parent: true
  definitions:
    - name: 'Framework: Core'
      code_paths: ['src/core/**']
    - name: 'Experience: UI'
      code_paths: ['src/components/**']
gates:
  format: npx prettier --check .
  lint: npm run lint
  typecheck: npm run typecheck
  test: npm test
```

```bash
# Create and claim a work unit
pnpm wu:create --id WU-001 --title "Add user auth" --lane "Framework: Core" \
  --type feature --exposure backend-only \
  --description "Add authentication" --acceptance "Users can log in" \
  --code-paths "src/auth/" --test-paths-unit "src/auth/__tests__/"

pnpm wu:claim --id WU-001 --lane "Framework: Core"

# Work in the worktree
cd worktrees/framework-core-wu-001
# ... make changes ...

# Run gates and complete (from repo root)
pnpm gates
cd /path/to/repo && pnpm wu:done --id WU-001
```
