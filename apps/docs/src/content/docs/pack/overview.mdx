title: Software Delivery Pack
description: The default pack providing WU lifecycle, lanes, gates, memory, and secure template-first pack authoring

import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The **Software Delivery Pack** is the default domain pack shipped with LumenFlow. It provides everything you need for structured software delivery — from work unit lifecycle to quality gates to agent coordination.

<Aside type="note" title="Pack architecture">
  LumenFlow's [kernel](/concepts/kernel) is domain-agnostic — it provides scope enforcement, policy
  evaluation, and evidence recording. Packs add domain-specific tools and policies. The Software
  Delivery Pack is the first production pack. Additional domains should ship as fully implemented
  packs using the same manifest contract.

## CLI Commands

The pack registers **100+ CLI commands** across these categories:

| Category              | Examples                                         | Count |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| WU Lifecycle          | `wu:create`, `wu:claim`, `wu:prep`, `wu:done`    | 20+   |
| Memory & Sessions     | `mem:checkpoint`, `mem:inbox`, `mem:signal`      | 14    |
| Initiatives           | `initiative:create`, `initiative:status`         | 8     |
| Gates & Validation    | `gates`, `wu:validate`, `lumenflow-doctor`       | 6     |
| Packs                 | `pack:author`, `pack:install`, `pack:validate`   | 6     |
| Metrics & Flow        | `flow:report`, `flow:bottlenecks`, `metrics`     | 5     |
| Agent & Orchestration | `wu:brief`, `wu:delegate`, `orchestrate:monitor` | 7     |

See the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli) for the complete command list.

## Secure Template Authoring (No-Code)

The recommended path for new packs is template-first authoring:

```bash
pnpm pack:author
pnpm pack:validate
```

Template generation enforces least-privilege defaults and validation catches
unsafe scope/network configurations before install or publish.

Install command shape:

```bash
pnpm pack:install --id <packId> --source registry --version <version>
```

## Pack Policies

The Software Delivery Pack ships with policies that the kernel evaluates automatically:

- **Gate policies** — Format, lint, typecheck, and test gates run `on_completion` with deny-wins semantics
- **Scope policies** — Lane-based path restrictions enforced on every tool call
- **Constraint policies** — Non-negotiable rules like "no edits outside worktrees" and "no force-push"

See the [Policy Engine](/concepts/policy-engine) for how these are evaluated.

## Why the Software Delivery Pack?

If you are a software team using AI agents, the Software Delivery Pack replaces ad-hoc methodologies with a structured, evidence-based workflow. Here is how it compares to traditional approaches:

### Work Units, Not Stories

Traditional tickets are vague — "Add user authentication." Work Units are **executable specifications** with acceptance criteria, code paths, and test paths. An AI agent can read a WU spec and implement it autonomously. A human can verify completion by checking the criteria.

### Lanes, Not Sprints

Scrum batches work into time-boxed sprints. The Software Delivery Pack flows work through **parallel lanes** — each with a WIP limit (typically 1 for solo work, 2 for teams). Work flows continuously instead of waiting for sprint boundaries.

### Gates, Not Reviews

Code review is a bottleneck. The Software Delivery Pack replaces manual review with **automated quality gates** — format, lint, typecheck, and test checks that must all pass before work can be completed. Critical changes can still require human approval via escalation triggers.

### Memory, Not Standups

Daily standups exist because humans forget context. The Software Delivery Pack's **memory layer** provides checkpointing and context recovery, so both humans and AI agents can resume exactly where they left off.

### Stamps, Not Done Columns

Kanban boards have "Done" columns. The Software Delivery Pack creates **immutable stamps** — created only when all acceptance criteria pass, all gates pass, and work is merged. No ambiguity.

### Comparison Table

| Aspect      | Scrum              | Kanban      | Shape Up       | Software Delivery Pack |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Time unit   | 2-week sprints     | Continuous  | 6-week cycles  | Continuous             |
| Work item   | User story         | Card        | Pitch          | Work Unit (WU)         |
| Progress    | Story points       | Cycle time  | Hill charts    | Gates + stamps         |
| Parallelism | Team velocity      | WIP limits  | Team per pitch | Lane-based WIP         |
| Reviews     | Sprint review + PR | PR review   | Demo           | Automated gates        |
| AI-ready    | No                 | Partially   | No             | Yes                    |
| Context     | Human memory       | Board state | Write-up       | Memory layer           |

<Aside type="tip">
  The Software Delivery Pack can complement existing methodologies. Use Scrum for planning and
  stakeholder communication, but execute actual work with the WU/gates/stamps flow.
