title: Software Delivery Pack
description: The default pack providing WU lifecycle, lanes, gates, memory, and 100+ CLI commands

The **Software Delivery Pack** is the default domain pack shipped with LumenFlow. It provides everything you need for structured software delivery — from work unit lifecycle to quality gates to agent coordination.

<Aside type="note" title="Pack architecture">
  LumenFlow's [kernel](/architecture/kernel) is domain-agnostic — it provides scope enforcement, policy
  evaluation, and evidence recording. Packs add domain-specific tools and policies. The Software Delivery
  Pack is the first production pack; others (compliance-audit, infra-ops, security-ops) are planned.

## What the Pack Provides

  <Card title="Work Units" icon="document">
    Atomic units of work with YAML specs, worktree isolation, and lifecycle tracking.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Lanes" icon="bars">
    Scoped work streams with WIP limits, lock policies, and path-based access control.
    [Learn more →](/concepts/lanes)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gates" icon="approve-check">
    Config-driven quality checks (format, lint, typecheck, test) enforced as kernel policies.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Layer" icon="puzzle">
    Session tracking, checkpoints, coordination signals, and context recovery for agents.

## CLI Commands

The pack registers **100+ CLI commands** across these categories:

| Category | Examples | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WU Lifecycle | `wu:create`, `wu:claim`, `wu:prep`, `wu:done` | 20+ |
| Memory & Sessions | `mem:checkpoint`, `mem:inbox`, `mem:signal` | 14 |
| Initiatives | `initiative:create`, `initiative:status` | 8 |
| Gates & Validation | `gates`, `wu:validate`, `lumenflow-doctor` | 6 |
| Packs | `pack:scaffold`, `pack:validate`, `pack:publish` | 6 |
| Metrics & Flow | `flow:report`, `flow:bottlenecks`, `metrics` | 5 |
| Agent & Orchestration | `wu:brief`, `wu:delegate`, `orchestrate:monitor` | 7 |

See the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli) for the complete command list.

## Pack Policies

The Software Delivery Pack ships with policies that the kernel evaluates automatically:

- **Gate policies** — Format, lint, typecheck, and test gates run `on_completion` with deny-wins semantics
- **Scope policies** — Lane-based path restrictions enforced on every tool call
- **Constraint policies** — Non-negotiable rules like "no edits outside worktrees" and "no force-push"

See the [Policy Engine](/architecture/policy-engine) for how these are evaluated.
