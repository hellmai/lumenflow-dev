# Cursor Rules for LumenFlow

CRITICAL: Before starting any work, read this file completely:
docs/04-operations/_frameworks/lumenflow/agent/onboarding/starting-prompt.md

This contains all the rules you must follow, including:
- How to claim and complete Work Units (WUs)
- Worktree discipline (never edit files in main checkout)
- Gate failures and recovery
- LUMENFLOW_FORCE usage

DO NOT skip reading the starting-prompt.md - it prevents the most common failures.
